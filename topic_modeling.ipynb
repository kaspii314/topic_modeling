    "# Topic Modeling: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) vs. BERTopic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kate Stadelman\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique for discovering topics in a collection of documents, allowing you to see hidden structure in your text data. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** (LDA), which was first presented in 2003 by David Blei, Andrew Ng and Michael I. Jordan, long reigned as the premier topic modeling method. However, **BERTopic** by Maarten Grootendorst burst on the scene in 2022, leveraging recent advancements in large language models. In this sample project, we will focus less on the mathematics behind these methods and more on practical differences between LDA and BERTopic and the basics of how to make topic models.\n"

    "| **LDA** | **BERTopic** |\n",
    "| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Bayesian probabilistic model that estimates probability distributions for topics in documents and words in topics. | Algorithm that leverages the transformer-based model BERT and c-TF-IDF to \"create dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions.\" (Grootendorst, 2022) |\n",
    "| Each document is assigned topic probabilities.<br /> - Document 1 is 80% Topic 3, 15% Topic 2, 5% Topic 5 | Each document is assigned to a single topic.<br /> - Document 1 is Topic 3 |\n",
    "| While extracted topics can be used to train classification models, topic generation is unsupervised. | Topic generation is unsupervised by default, but semi-supervised and supervised learning approaches are supported. |\n",
    "| All documents are assigned to at least one topic. | Outlier documents are assigned to Topic -1 (no real topic). |\n",
    "| No simple mechanism to merge topics. | Overlapping topics can be easily merged. |\n",
    "| Coherence and perplexity measures readily available for topic evaluation. In practice, these measures may be less effective than using visualizations. | While you can maneuver Gensim (LDA) to calculate coherence and perplexity scores on BERTopic topics, BERTopic does not have these built-in for topic evaluation. However, there are many excellent visualizations available. |\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Topic Models: Past, Present, Future](https://gradientflow.com/topic-models-past-present-future/), David Blei, co-creator of LDA, discusses how topic modeling allows you to \"zoom in and zoom out\" on your text data. You can tune your topic model to find a few major themes or many refined categories. In practice, we have found that tuning topic models is more of an art than a science. Visualizations are often much more effective than coherence and perplexity measures at finding the \"best\" model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the intention of this article is to provide an overview of topic modeling methods, we leave the nuances of fine-tuning models for future articles. Just know that the tuning process is not necessarily straightforward and depends on what you are trying to accomplish."

    "## Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating our models, we review a few key NLP concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: In NLP, tokenization is the task of breaking up documents into smaller chunks of text for processing. \"Sentence Tokenization\" splits documents into sentences, while \"Word Tokenization\" splits documents into words. There are a myriad of tokenizers available for use. The NLTK library even has a specialized TweetTokenizer designed for the emojis and hashtags found in tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stemming**: Stemming is an NLP technique for transforming words to their root form by chopping off suffixes like \"-ing\", \"-es\", and \"-ed\" (e.g. plays, played, playing -> play).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lemmatization**: Lemmatization is an NLP technique for transforming words to their root form using a dictionary (e.g. is, are, was -> be). Stemming is more performant than lemmitzation, but lemmatization is more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stop Words**: Stop words are commonly used words in a language (e.g. \"a\", \"an\", \"the\" in English) that occur frequently without contributing much to meaning. Stop words have historically been ignored or removed for many NLP tasks, including search engine queries and in the data preperation step for LDA topic modeling. While LLMs do not require stop word removal prior to generating embeddings, BERTopic still removes stop words when creating topic representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TF-IDF**: Both LDA and BERTopic topic modeling use a form of TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency). While we will not delve into the math here, know that TF-IDF measures the importance of a word to a document in a collection of documents. Suppose we have a collection of financial news articles. If we counted up all the words in each article, perhaps we find that one article mentions the word \"stock\" 10 times and \"earnings\" 5 times, while another article mentions \"stock\" 8 times and \"t\"ech\" 5 times. Even though \"stock\" is the most frequent term in both articles, it provides less information about comparing the subject of each than \"earnings\" and \"tech.\""

I ordered a Americana at the drive through at a very slow time. I paid lady with app and then she disappeared, I waited extra long and then a man came and handed me my drink after someone else was behind me on the drive through. When I picked up my drink for first time while driving the lid popped off and the coffee spilled on my hand burning it, my lap, my envelope I was mailing with a check, my car and car seat. I am lucky I did not get into an accident. I called store and spoke with manager to tell her what happened. I am very offended by her response, she said sorry and explained how it could not possibly be their fault because they triple check the lid. OBVIOUSLY they did not and I should not have had to argue with her. \n",

It was fine going in, placing my order and paying for it but getting my coffee there was some sort of problem. My order was in and all the rest of the people about 5 or 6 people after me in the queue, all got theirs and I was still waiting for mine. So, I just asked for my money back as I never had all day to wait. I, myself, have medical problems and after a 2-hour drive, it would be nice to have a cup of coffee before having to drive back to Aberdeen.\n",

       "609    Had a few bad experiences at a local Starbucks, 3 out of the last 5 drinks were wrong. So I wrote a complaint to Starbucks customer relations. About a day later I got an email, that even said they would look into the service at at location. About 2 weeks later, I got a letter and 2 free drink cards sent. I definitely think it's a step in the right directions, some locations have offered great service and this location continued to provide subpar even at times bad service. The reply although won't fix the location, it's a hope it might and definitely more than I have ever received from McDonald's, the 10s of times I've complaint about a particular location, primarily the one right next to my house. So yes all in all the overall customer service I have received from Starbucks have been positive. Attached the letter and coupons, had to cut of the top half of the letter, because my name is in it and unfortunately it also cropped out the Starbucks header.\n",

Let me write down what I have gone through: 1. Collected stickers (18 beverages) to collect 2019 Planner/Organizer. (Completed 4 Sets). 2. I have redeemed 2 of them. By February, their stocks were low, and choices were limited. The barista told me to wait for \"restocking\" for more choices. 3. By March, there were ZERO stocks and I was not able to collect 2 Planners. Baristas told me two choices: a) Wait until May; or b) Get 1,500 Php = 29.33 USD for each set. I decided to wait knowing that I have collected these stickers for the planner/organizer. I have spent more than 3,000Php per set and it does not compensate me with 1,500Php.\n",

I pay more for a bad cup of coffee for over five months that I've been back in Texas. I can't get a Caramel Macchiato that is worth drinking even if my life depends on it.

Stop words are still useful for BERTopic after clustering of our embeddings during the construction of our topic representations, so we will ultimately use the same stop word list for both models, but just at different points in the process."

Interestingly, the best coherence and perplexity scores do not always lead to the best model. Compare files lda_pyLDAvis_tuned.html (best scored model) vs. lda_pyLDAvis.html (final).

It does this by constraining the size of the local neighborhood UMAP will look at when attempting to learn the manifold structure of the data. This means that low values of n_neighbors will force UMAP to concentrate on very local structure (potentially to the detriment of the big picture), while large values will push UMAP to look at larger neighborhoods of each point when estimating the manifold structure of the data, losing fine detail structure for the sake of getting the broader of the data.\n",

At a normal Starbucks, they get a pound of coffee a week, and I don't get any discounts. I get none of that, and I don't even get discounts on drinks. I find this unfair to all Starbucks, Safeway employees. I need to know why we don't get benefits just because I work in Safeway.",
          "I've always loved Starbucks because they were nice and clean. I assumed buying items would come with reasonable return policy because the quality seemed high and the prices too. My wife bought me a coffee grinder for Christmas in 2016. The blade came off this morning and I thought it would be easy to return, I carried it all the way downtown and asked them if they had any warranty with things they sell, they were rude, accused me of stretching the dates and implied I was unreasonable to expect a grinder to work more than a few years even though the truth is I hardly ever used it. They said they would give me the customer service phone no. and I waited 20 minutes for that. Then I waited for 20 minutes minimum for a person, my ear was sore from the cell phone, I switched ears and talked to the rep who said \"ALL items are only returnable for 30 days\" with receipt.",
          "I used to go to this place almost every day. One day I ordered a Cup of English breakfast Tea. When I started to add sugar and Cream I found a floating saliva in the cup. I was so frustrated to complain about. That was last time ever in Starbucks stores.",
          "Over the past couple of years, I've noticed several things. First, the shots of espresso are not full anymore. Second, the cups are not full anymore. Third, consistency is not the same throughout all stores. These are reason enough to go somewhere else. Let alone the company changing its free drink program so you have to spend a hefty dollar amount to get a free drink. I really think the company thinks we are all stupid!",
          "Got to Starbucks inside Food City before 6 pm. Asked for a large decaf. I was told they could only do a half caf. Very disappointed in their logistics function. A viable business should have its ordering of supplies rather optimized by the time they are a mature business.",
          "This was a drink I was really looking forward to trying. It's the new fad so of course I had to try it. I only was able to stomach 1/4 of it and threw the rest away. I felt sick to my stomach. I took tums and they didn't help. I thought I was going to throw up and ended up sitting my whole evening out because I was so sick and felt so horrible. I would not recommend this drink. Not only is it not worth the price, it isn't worth the stomach ache and pain. Never going to drink this again. Very disappointed.",
          "I went into your Starbucks store located at: 1356 Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica, California 90401 (310) 458-0266 and did NOT have a very good Starbucks Experience. I arrived just a little bit before 6:00 p.m. and at around 6:00 p.m. continuing onwards, your room temperature was extremely cold and uncomfortable during my Starbucks Dining Experience! I did complain about it and was told that they could do absolutely NOTHING ABOUT IT! This is far what I expect as a very loyal Starbucks gold card customer for the past seven (7) years!",

This has happened to me few times during the past few years at different Starbucks locations in London. The prices are getting more expensive which is ridiculous. Another bad thing happened at Starbucks Slough branch, I had to wait too long in a very slow moving queue of people and my order was not made as requested at the end. Employees are idiots. As usual, Starbucks Customer Service is absolute RUBBISH. Starbucks MUST BE SHUT DOWN and definitely not worth the amount of money it currently has.",
          "I was poisoned by my smoothie. After a few hours, my stomachache got worse and worse. Then came 24 hours of extreme vomiting. Could not even keep water down. I got fever, the runs. If I can't keep water down by tomorrow, it is off to the hospital for me. Starbucks needs to pay better attention to product handling and storage. I will never ever go back.",
          "They charge ~5$ for a chai tea Latte and does not train the employees how to make them, each store make it their own way. Horrific experience today at a Starbucks in Riverside, CA. They literally give me boiling Milk. I asked them to add more tea, then the lady in the store asked me, “You want more syrup?” How the hell a customer know you are using a secret syrup to make Chai tea latte. I repeatedly asked I need more tea.. Of course she got angry.. I have to walk away with the boiling milk. First of all you make the worst chai tea latte, still I am drinking it and you make it worst. Don't exploit customers like this. Hopefully somebody sees this and take necessary action.",
          "I think you should know that as a long time consistent customer, I am actively seeking a different coffee shop. I frequent Starbucks throughout Southern California, usually spending up to an hour or slightly longer. The environment is always freezing. I've mentioned this to the baristas in San Diego (Point Loma), Temecula (all of them, especially the one I often go to in the Meadows). It doesn't matter what time of year it is, the air conditioning is always cranking. Nothing ever changes and no one cares. My only recourse is to give up and start going to coffee places which are inviting and comfortable. Thought you should know.",
          "On 3/23/2014 at approx. 5:40pm I went to the drive thru Starbucks located on 32340 Alvarado Blvd, Union City, CA 94587. Upon arrival, my boyfriend asked if a drip coffee was available as we are not heavy coffee drinkers and wanted to venture out of our usual drinks. The barista first laughed and I can clearly hear from the drive thru window of her telling her colleagues of what we ordered while chuckling, then she asked what size we wanted. We ordered a tall and then proceeded to ask if an Americano was stronger in caffeine or the drip coffee. She sarcastically said that coffee is stronger than espresso, but was chuckling the whole time and double repeated that I just wanted a \"tall plain black coffee\". We then proceeded to the window and the same barista leaned out of the window to say, \"I'm sorry that I laughed, but you don't think we have coffee here at a coffee shop?\" ",
          "I know the world's so crazy although all these big chains that people flock to. Starbucks has no customer service, maybe no training idk?! I do know the coffee was horrible, not what ordered & super expensive! The worst part was my dog Chloe was diagnosed with bladder cancer last year & been wanting to take her to get a puppuccino, heard so many good thinking, yea it's a dog treat made with dogs in mind, great ingredients. Right, wow so wrong, a little plastic cup filled with canned whip cream! Really Starbucks! Nothing else to say except Starbucks suck bottom line! Why is it when companies become successful their quality goes way down and price way up!",
          "I'm not sure what's up with the distribution center for the Starbucks in North Carolina specifically from Concord, Salisbury, all the way up to Winston-Salem, but if you want any of your favorite sandwiches or flavors or even water you will be told they are out because the distribution doesn't Supply the stores! I'm told that since the Christmas specials starting back in November, most people couldn't get the holiday favorites because the stores didn't received supplies in all the local stores. I don't understand how you run a business when your Distribution Center can't Supply the local stores with items that people want to buy. Like pay cash and enjoy the products oh, isn't that what business is about? Serving the customer and receiving the money?",
          "I was now 5.6.2015 in your branch in Soliman Abaza Street with a lady and a man serving and I asked for 2 mango cheese cake and I was shocked that they throwing the service to each other and after I paid no one brought me it and the man swore that he'll not bring it. I was really shocked with such disgusting service.",
          "Starbucks has implemented a \"one button\" entry for a Peppermint White Chocolate Mocha as part of their holiday promotion. This button rings the drink up as a single item, costing $4.75 for a Venti sized drink. Prior to this programming change, the same drink would come through the receipt as a White Chocolate Mocha costing $4.25 with a separate line item for the Peppermint costing $.50. This difference is not visible to the consumer until the conclusion of their transaction. When the customer pays with a Starbucks Gold Card, the modifier charge is removed, reducing the price of the drink by $.50 -- one of the specific benefits of the Gold Card. When the drink has been entered as a single item, there is no modifier line to be removed, therefore there is no deduction for the peppermint that was added to the drink.",
          "I forgot my mask realized and used my additional shirt to cover my face upon entry. Waited in a line for 5-10 minutes. He refused service saying I had to have an actual mask - meanwhile there was a dog in the store - I can’t be positive but I don’t think he had gloves on and he fist-bumped the customer in front of me.  I said I’ve waited in here this entire time I will go outside if you can still take my order. Nope... All the while I had a shirt covering my face and nose...",
          "My first time visiting this particular store and my last Starbucks purchase. I went to the drive thru and my debit card was pulled out of my hand along with grabbing a couple fingers. I don't know if he heard me, but I said please don't pull my card like that. Too late. While returning my card, he put it between his two fingers, like he was a card dealer in Vegas. He flipped it out the window and on to the ground. I picked my brand new card up, out of filth. If he did that in a store 5 miles east of there, he'd be fired on the spot. Multi millionaires don't put up with that. Come on people, get your caffeine fix at a convenience store down the street. I am. I work too hard for my money, and have too much respect for myself, to be treated like that.",
          "Starbucks used to have the best Hot Chocolate around, but I stopped into their St Ann Missouri, store for a Hot Chocolate today, it has been a couple years since I got one, alas it was a crappy brown water waste of money, not the rich, creamy, chocolate it used to be, I Will not be going back for any of their overpriced garbage anymore....",
          "I ordered 2 quad shot venti skim lattes with whipped. Paid just over $11 bucks. What I got were 2 barely over halfway filled cups! The guy actually said that he used the larger sized cups to accommodate for the whipped. Acted like he was doing me such a wonderful favor! Seriously? I ordered venti and got venti cups. Not my first time at Starbucks but I was so pissed off that it may possibly be my last visit to Starbucks! Of course I didn't get a receipt either. Coincidental? I think not.",

My daughter and I went there yesterday and it was watery and not as nearly wonderful! So we will go the extra miles to go to the one that knows what they are doing! Our money is just as important as your money!",
          "The Starbucks coffee drinks cost a good deal of money. So when I pay for a coffee drink. I expect to get coffee, not a milkshake. But there are milkshakes hidden in the Frappuccino menu. If it is for kids. It should be labeled \"kids drinks\" or \"milkshakes.\" That is just really disappointing. I ordered a Strawberry Creme Frappuccino, thinking that it was like the Strawberry funnel Cake Frappuccino, which was really good and had coffee in it. But they stopped selling that and instead there was just this disappointing strawberry milkshake that I ended up with. ",
          "I was in line for 15 min before having to leave for an appointment. Never did get coffee. Unacceptable! Location is Petoskey, MI. Drive through Starbucks on us 131! Need to investigate what is wrong at this site. I don't have time to wait that long.",
          "I want to share with you a story about how Starbucks really feels about you. I am a Starbucks almost daily regular, so much so that they sent me one of their gold cards. I was in the Starbucks in Vallejo, California at the junction of 780 & 80 the Monday before last, waiting in line and another customer came in to the store, who was obviously angry and troubled though I did not know why. I felt that he was on the verge of doing something although I did not know what. One of the counter people then smiled and said something to him, which eased my apprehension for a moment. ",
          "I was the only person in line. I ordered a hot item, which was put in the oven. Then a woman shows up after me. The associate took my hot item out of the oven, laid it on the counter and then proceeded to go into the back room, get out a sandwich, put that in the oven, all the while letting my food go cold. Then he packaged both items and gave the customer-come-lately HER still hot food while leaving mine on the counter. I am guessing the other customer paid with the mobile app and was given precedence over a person ACTUALLY in the store and having already placed her order. This is exactly what I feared would happen: people who can afford a smartphone jump every line and get serviced first.",
          "Today is 05/29/2016. I would like to make a complaint about the 5:00 Starbucks shift on this date at this time. I was cheated out of my change (money) on this day by one of the workers and I was told it is a policy by the manager or supervisor named ** that I am not able to get refill with lemonade inside of my tea at this particular location on 1258 South La Brea Ave; Los Angeles, CA 90019-1628, Telephone 323-934-2408 even though I paid the $0.50 fee. I am not a new customer and whoever these workers are that worked today on this shift is not good workers. The workers are currently not being supervised if they are dancing while at work and treating clients inappropriately. No refills? Saying that is not company policy seems like an lie. Every other Starbucks I go to allow refills. Thank you. Also restroom needs to be cleaned. There was urine all over the toilet. Thank you.",

They used to greet me and be fast. But I was gone sick for a week. When I came back I was ignored every time. No hello or nothing. ** rude and fake. They even greeted customers around me. I was invisible. I'll never step foot in there again. Gone way down too with staff. Also older redhead always attitude and pissed at world. She stopped saying hi to me decades ago. ** that store.

And I ordered two grande mocha. He didn't not fill it up. It was halfway filled. Are you serious? I don't remember the guy's name.",
          "I visit Starbucks drive-thru on a very regular basis and always order the same thing, a triple venti, non-fat, no-whip mocha. Most of the time I receive what I ordered. But here lately, at the store on Denton Hwy 377 in Watauga, Tx they continuously get it wrong. So be to sure, I always take a sip to be sure. But this morning was ridiculous.",
          "I very rarely drink coffee so I'm very particular. I only order two things from Starbucks, hot chocolate when it's cold or a double chocolate chip frappuccino. I have been ordering this same thing for years but the last 3 times my frappuccino has been wrong and each time they have told me something different. First time I politely went inside and told them that I didn't like my drink...guy apologized said he accidentally made a Java chip frappuccino and made me the right drink (my drink is actually a lighter color than the wrong one). Second time, same store, again I don't like my drink I'm polite but this time I'm told they accidentally used roasted coffee making the drink stronger... He remakes it again it's a lighter color and everything is fine. ",

The coffee was very hot, and I was about 30 miles away before I took a drink, and then realized that they had not put in the cream. Charging $.70 for cream is a rip-off; failing to give me what I paid for is theft.",

Anyone else thoroughly FED UP with Starbucks?",

I now have a scar on my left hand and had 1-3 degree burns from this incident. This happened at Store # 7373, 107 e 43rd Street, Space MC-72, New York, NY 212 599 4368.",

          "I wanted to have a tall americano with 2 espresso double shots coffee as I do usually from starbucks. I had to explain 3 times what I wanted to the guy at the cash counter until he understood. The lady who was preparing the coffee took almost 10 minutes to prepare the coffee and when told her I wanted the extra double espresso shot as I ordered she didn't like what I said, and looked at me in an intimidating, angry and rude way and talked to me like I'm ordering a coffee for the first time in my life and said \"The coffee is already made with 2 shots\" and she didn't even offer to fix this. I never experienced anything like this in my life with starbucks. I am shocked.",

I told her that I had never heard of this policy and I offered to pay her for the hot water, then she said there wasn't any way that she could Charge me for the water, of course I became puzzled and asked her to please accept the money, even though I found this to be ridiculous and she went on to tell me \"Starbucks has always charged customers for cups and water whether you have our brand or not\"!",
          "I have been a consistent customer of Starbucks for well over 10+ years, and have had some minor issues. Some I addressed others I simply let slide, mostly due to my rapport with the management managerial staff AND Baristas but however, my rapport is of little consequence after my recent experience at the hands of Starbucks. Apparently, they felt the need to take it upon themselves following a day's regular purchase of my caramel macchiato with 4 espresso shots no foam at 200 degrees. They then took an additional 150 stars from my rewards 3 consecutive times on the same day. ",

When I received my beverage I was surprised to see the mug only partially filled. I didn't have time to ask for a replacement because I had to go to work??? I didn't drink any of it until I arrived at work and by then it had shrunk to half the size of the mug.",

When I was given my hot caramel lattes, they didn't have any caramel in the latte, just milk and coffee without any flavor. This is the first time I had ever had any difficulty ordering my lattes and my marble cake. If given this place a rating of stars, it would get the lowest being 1/2 star.",
          "Ok so, I already had in mind to stop going to Starbucks since it was costing me like 250$ a month. When I saw on Tiktok how unhealthy their drinks really are, I just knew I had slow down my intake. But today that was it for me. They told me that to have a free drink is no longer 150 stars - it’s now required to accumulate 200 Stars. No way, this is a sign from the Universe for me to really stop drinking their unhealthy drinks. They can go and require 1000 Stars for a free drink if they wish - I don’t care because, I really am not interested anymore.",
          "In the last couple weeks I start seeing my quad espresso getting half of the amount I usually was getting. When I asked, the Coffee Shop manager told me that Starbucks is changing the amount of the water in a single espresso shot. Now for the same money I'm getting less espresso. On top of it it is so bitter without the regular water amount it is hardly good for pleasure drinking. I suspect they would like to get their lines moving faster, but how about \"The great coffee experience at Starbucks!\" we all are lure to experience. That is extremely unfair and unjust practice. And since they are the only coffee shop in the near 50 miles around places I go you can imagine my disappointment and frustration with the half of the quad, super bitter, not healthy way of serving espresso at Starbucks.",
          "I would give Starbucks zero stars if I could. I received an email that I would be receiving a birthday reward on the day of my birthday and it would be good on the day of my birthday only. The email also stated that the reward would be for any drink or food item. I went to an Starbucks near my home. The cashier told me my coupon had expired. I told her I don't have a coupon. Its a birthday reward. I ordered a sandwich. The cashier said I could only purchase a drink. I showed her the email. She said, let's try it and swiped my card. She said it didn't take so she asked if I wanted a drink. I told her to just give me a venti hot coffee. She swiped my card again and said it didn't work. Then she asked, \"Are you sure it's your birthday?\" I showed her the email that said in big letters, 7/15. I told her this is July 15 and this is my birthday. ",

I was there this morning at 6:15 and the woman at the window just had her hand stuck out of the window and her head turned the other way.  I handed her my money and I had her tip ready to give to her but when she handed me my coffee, she did the same thing.  She never looked at me the entire time.  She is at the window a lot and she is never friendly.  You can tell that she obviously hates her job and should never be at the window.  She is the only one that is like that at this location and I am getting tired of it.",

The clerk taking my order began to educate me about what the sizes of cups were called, what a barista was and what Starbucks represented. I indicated to him that I did not want to learn any of what he was telling me, that I felt no compelling need to learn their corporate culture and that, please, may I have a small coffee. He became bellicose. I assured him that he would not suffer my presence in his coffee shop in the future. I won’t be back and BTW, the coffee tasted burnt.",

I ordered grande latte and I had to wait so long because the person who was doing the drinks did 4 drinks for 4 people who came after me and placed their order after me. I told him that I placed my order before these people and what he did wasn't right. He said to me in a very rude way, \"I'll get your drink and you'll get the ** out of here\". He added, \"Starbucks doesn't want to have customers like you\". I was totally shocked by what he said and I asked that I want to speak to the store manager.

          "Recently Starbucks changed the design of their coffee cup lids. They're hard to put back on after you put cream and sugar in your coffee. I told Starbucks stores that they're not safe and they said I should call 800 number. Who has an hour to sit and chat on the phone with 800 numbers. Well last week I sat in my car comfortably with a nice hot Starbucks coffee in my hand and luckily didn't start driving. I was holding the cup in my left hand and was getting ready to start the car. Guys the lid came off. The coffee went from steering wheel to my legs, to my carpet. I called Starbucks 800 number and rep who answered was wonderful, concerned and asked numerous time if I was ok. He apologized and said he was sending this to high authority. Haha. What higher authority. They don't care. It's been a week and nothing. I can tell you one thing. This will happen to wrong person someday and Starbucks will care.",

That said, I pulled up to a Starbucks drive thru and saw a tip jar hanging out the take out window and thought to myself, \"No way, I must be hallucinating\". I'm seeing way too many tip jars as it is everywhere I go and it sickens me. It's equal to a person saying,\"hey if you don't tip me, you are not as cool as the people that do\". Look, I gladly tip at restaurants because it's a way to establish how one is to be treated. Plus, there are other people involved other than the waitress such as the bus boy, etc... ",

They only celebrate Starbucks Happy Hour in May for 3 days, instead of from May 3rd through May 15th like other Starbucks. In October I ordered a grande Frapula. One day I was charged $5.65, the next day I order the same beverage and size and was charged $6.75. There is never a supervisor or authoritative figure in the store to assure quality, customer satisfaction and cleanliness, or to go to if you have a discrepancy.

Starbucks will be losing valuable customers like myself who has been a Gold Card Member since 2009. I go to Starbucks 3 to 4 times a week. Mostly for their coffee drinks and earn stars; 12 stars for a free drink \"now\" that is changing from 12 stars to 125 stars for a free drink. Also another bummer is to be a \"Gold Card\" member it was 30 stars now it is 300 stars. Who are they kidding! The other coffee companies are loving it... they will be getting Starbucks customers. Starbucks is not caring about their customers if they impose this outrageous plan. At least I will stop in to say Hello to the great staff at all of the Myrtle Beach Starbucks. Lets be Americans and vote \"NO Change!\" Thanks.",
          "Every Starbucks I have visited recently to purchase the organic \"Breakfast Blend\" has the employees giving the same identical statement, \"all coffee is organic until ground\". Really? Then why doesn't it state on the package that it is organic? How would grinding the coffee make it NOT organic anymore? Why can't the employees at Starbucks be honest and simply state that Starbucks doesn't carry the \"Breakfast Blend\" in organic anymore? They do carry ONE type of organic coffee, but it is a very strong blend, and it does state ORGANIC on the package. IF it is ALL ORGANIC (until ground), then why don't the other packages state \"ORGANIC\" on the package? They are implying that through the grinding process (even at your home) chemicals are added to your coffee beans (grind). Do they even know what the term \"ORGANIC\" means? Then how could anyone trust the word \"ORGANIC\" on their Yukon package?",

They went to work with other orders leaving the glass that I had to deliver to the front of the window, realizing, like any adult, that these young men or Gregorio made me wait when the order was ready, normally when it is by servi car we leave the change or leave extra.

So whatever I tried it and omg never again will I try something new from them again. Very disgusting. The drink was horrible. The service was awesome. I got the youth berry and the caramel one.

When I went back inside they said “oh sorry we gave you the car's drink that was behind. Here’s yours.” I informed them of the seriousness of their mistake. My hives have finally cleared up. I reported it to Starbucks and I have a case number.

The male barista greeted me, and I asked for a tall cup of hot water, because I had a VIA (that I actually bought from that Starbucks, two days prior). He said sure, and he went over to pour the hot water and said (in a very snappy tone) \"I'll give you a small cup\". At first I thought she was offering me a small cup, because that's the size that's recommended with a VIA.

All I wanted was a simple refund and was told over the phone that I could take it to Starbucks HQ since I am in close proximity which I did this morning. I have never been treated so rude and with such condescending attitudes as I was on the 8th floor by two customer service receptionists who had no interest in listening to me or assisting me. I was eventually told to make my way to their loading dock and see if anything there could help me. I always felt Starbucks was the \"Nordstrom\" of coffee restaurants but after today I clearly see different.",
          "I was in the drive thru at the Barranca Ave. West Covina Starbucks yesterday at 3:40pm. I was picking up 3 grande ice tea for coaches at a nearby high school baseball game. I asked to have each ring up separately. I was told that there is a limit of 2 transactions at the drive thru??? Funny, a week earlier I ordered 4 separate orders at the same drive thru without any trouble? The car in front of me had 4 separate transactions as I watched the customer have her phone scanned 4 separate times?",
          "I ordered two ice teas and requested no water or syrup, but did request extra ice. The clerk rang the order up and then told me she would have to charge me an extra 75 cents for each drink because I had ask for NO water. The charge was rung up as though I had ask for syrup in the drinks. A dollar fifty for NO water. I find this very hard to believe that the Base Exchange would tack on such a charge. I did some research by going to five other Starbucks (not on military bases) and none have such a charge. I talked to the Starbucks manager and she informed the Exchange manager Mr. ** had instituted the charge. I phoned Mr. ** and was told he was unavailable. I left a message and ask that he contact me. That was more than a week ago and have not received a call back. Why would such a charge be allowed? The clerk was Linda **. The date was January 3, 2016 11:46 A. This is the information taken from the receipt.",

Their staff refused him a refill. ** the supervisor in charge at 4341 International Village Vancouver BC Starbucks location claimed the manager ended free refills for customers. My friend gradually related to her and stated The Starbucks refill policy and showed her the policy on his phone.

I even initiated a conversation with her once and was pretty much ignored. She does not seem like she likes working at Starbucks at all!",

Everyone needs to make a buck. I get it. I felt awkward because in the delivery, I felt it was insinuated that I had done something of ill will all this time I was getting matcha waters for a different price. Either way, I'm making homemade at home. Never coming in again.",

On my last visit I ordered my usual ’doppio macchiato’, instead, I received a plain doppio. The associate had no idea that expresso temperature is expected to exceed 160 degrees F. It was difficult to receive the refund on my payment, and no one offered to rectify the mistake in a manner that would alleviate the tension. NOT THE FIRST TIME!

So my wife and I are going about our business on a Saturday afternoon and decide to pick up a coffee from a drive through Starbucks. I get to the drive through entrance and get to the speaker where I stop and wait for someone to greet me. I wait about 4-5 minutes and nobody has spoken on the speaker. At this point I start saying, \"Hello, Hello\". I do this for the next 4-5 minutes, nobody talks to us. By now all the cars in front of us have been served and are gone and there is starting to be a line up behind us. So my wife tells me to just go to the window, maybe the speaker broke. So I get there, I see people working with the headset on their heads but nobody is talking and they didn't even look my way. I say hello to them... ignored. ",

          "Bought the Milk Frother at the official Starbucks website. Had been a client for years. Paid twice as much as similar product on stores because I thought that a company like Starbucks would check the quality and consequently back up their providers, all to find out that the product is of a very poor quality. Used it for not more than 20 times, paid $59.95 + Tax for a product that didn't last at all. When calling Starbucks customer service, they need all sort of information, to corroborate that it is actually one of their products. ",

I ordered a Grande and she said, \"We are out of Grande cups.\" I said, \"Oh, I understand.\" I paid and left. I drank my coffee, it was good as always. However, I went to throw it away, when I saw it was doubled with another cup. It was a TALL! I paid for a Grande! I just got ripped off at a good yet expensive coffee shop. This is the first time this has happened to me at a Starbucks. I have always known them to take pride in company. Oh well... Guess it happens to everyone. Warning= BE CAREFUL. Look at your drink carefully. I will from now on.",

At least four times the barista tipped the larger brewer giving me the \"bottom of the barrel.\" I'm glad I was watching. They apologized and gave me coffee from another container. I don't think it's the employee's fault, I'm sure they're following corp policy. Also I've witnessed so many discrepancies of cost, charges, add on charges, on and on. I've witnessed folks order food and ask where is the order. I hear the barista say \"I forgot, sorry.\" This with only a few customers in the store. Sadly it seems they don't pay the experienced baristas to stay and hire new folks and train them on the job. You hear at the register \"oh, excuse them they're in training\" or \"This is my second day.\" I only go to SBX if a friend is paying for my drink. :)",

She said, \"I can't take it back after you drank out of it.\" She proceeded to read the label on the cup then told me I had to throw it away myself if I wanted a new one. Another Barista who overheard the conversation stepped in and handled the situation appropriately. ** did not appear pleased.

NY customer service at Starbucks I guess is no different from the ones on this page from, Denver, NC, California, PA., GA, Canada, NJ, OH, KS, VA, TN, UT, SC, WA etc.! I'm sure the rest of the 50 States are here somewhere if I kept reading. Seems like Starbucks is not only on a roll for the worst customer service nationwide but for the decision to making customers wait even longer for a bagel or muffin that you don't even want toasted, or buttered, or for that matter baked! Which seems like what they might be doing for the length of time you are actually waiting for it. ",

I was so upset and took everything for me not to snatch her ** over that counter. Listen Starbucks. Your drinks are not that great and overpriced so you would think you would work on your customer service better and at least keep your store clean.

After finishing her drink she starts complaining from a terrible stomach ache, she threw up almost 17 times and went to the bathroom numerous times within 45 minutes. That drink was the only and 1st thing she had consumed that day. After the intensive episodes of throwing up she turned pale, her lips were blue and she was freezing cold shaking screaming from her abdominal pain. She said that it feels like a food poisoning episode or maybe they have put milk in her drink instead of the coconut milk. The music was so loud in the hotel that there's no way probably the and please will hear the order correctly. For something was wrong with the drink that she had food poisoning.",

I get charged extra for sweetened flavoring, but was at the Los Banos, CA location and was charged an extra 55 cents for milk. I asked the barista at the window why I was charged for something that is provided for free at the counter and she said that because she filled it up to the rim. It was a tall drink. It wasn't even like I asked for a gallon of milk!!! The girl talked to me like I was dumb.

All the nonsensical ways to order a large friggin' coffee made my knickers twist & I was looked at as if I had 3 heads when I didn't conform to their system & after having to point at the cup & getting an eye roll from the zit-faced teenager taking orders, I waited 10 minutes to be served the most vile, acidic sludge. As I guess I didn't know the lingo for extra sugar & 1/2 & 1/2, I was unamused with the speck of cream used & it certainly hadn't much sugar in it. ",

Logically if a grande has 2 shots then a vente should have 3. The shots have already been reduced in size over the years. Secondly Tips are based on performance...to ask us to tip before we can even finish cashing out is no right. You are pressuring us to leave a tip before we even get our coffee. What if the service stinks? I think you should go back to using a tip jar that way if the service is good we can tip and if not we can leave.

I know their food comes pre packaged and only warmed at the store, so I fault the company for falsely selling food that does not meet the picture on display at the ordering kiosk.

I checked it on the paper bag and it's not there, just wondering why didn't they asked me on the time that I'm paying for the tumbler if I would like to have the pen as well. Unfortunately I already left my receipt on the table so there's no way for me to claim my pen so I won't be able to design or doodle on my tumbler. It's sad and it's a bad customer service. They know that I am availing the doodle it tumbler, they never told me that I should have to ask for it or whatever. But I am basically a dissatisfied customer.",

This freaking lady had the audacity to rob me of my money and I’ll never forget that and the cheese pastry I got WAS CREAM CHEESE not just “cheese” like it said.

Typical, Starbucks doesn't care about their customers only the money. The customers had to call the police and ask for assistance because Starbucks didn't want to be bothered.

I asserted that it wasn't okay and that PA has a statewide mask mandate. The staff then offered to provide a mask. I stated that the customer should wait outside for the mask. When the customer re-entered the store wearing a mask, he kept lowering the mask, as if taunting me. The staff kept repeating, \"everything's okay\".

And bought a bag of chips and I asked if I could get two sample cups of their green tea and was just flat out refused. He the employee had said that we're not giving out samples at this time. BS! If I didn't know better, it seemed like he was happy NOT TO GIVE IT TO US. I had also made 2 trips to two other Starbucks stores earlier and had spent almost $20.00 dollars in total that day at 3 different stores. We like Starbucks EVEN THOUGH THEIR STUFF IS WAY OVERPRICED! A company that makes SOOO much money on a daily basis and BEING CHEAP ABOUT 2 sample cups of tea. I think I'll be staying away from Starbucks a lot more from now on!!! What a SHAME, worrying about 2 sample cups of tea and not about the money or potential tips that you could have earned. Oh well!!!",
          "The employees seem to have the same far left elitist attitude as the CEO and general direction of the company. Why anyone would spend $5 on coffee escapes me? For that $5 I can get a pound of coffee beans, store them in a vacuum container and grind fresh coffee every morning.",
          "Numerous Starbucks locations I frequent have indoor temps that are too cold. I have made calls to the 800 #, spoken to managers at the locations and even left a phone message with the district manager. I have spoken to other customers and they too have said that it is too cold. The AC is on in winter (yes, really) and when it is cold outside. I am beyond annoyed as I have been a loyal customer for years and have been trying to get an answer for more than one year. It is very uncomfortable to be wearing my coat inside and have semi frozen hands because everywhere I sit, there is a blast of cold air. This is extremely wasteful and uncomfortable for your customers. I am fed up by the lack of response to this. I am thinking of going elsewhere.",
          "Weak coffee - My husband and I ordered a bold coffee. It took at least five minutes to get 2 coffees. We noticed she was pouring hot water over the grounds. We questioned it because I have never had a coffee done like that. It was a new way they do it she said. We were traveling and tasted it about 5 minutes after we got it. We were on a tight schedule. We should have turned around. There was no coffee flavor at all. We go to Starbucks often. I would like to be reimbursed. The shop is in New Berlin, WI on Moorland Ave.",

When I got there, the store didn’t open until 5am. I requested for a refund, and I was advised only the customer service can credit my account. I sent snapshots of my order. The Starbucks Rewards claimed that wasn’t a valid receipt (snapshots came from their mobile app). If it wasn’t a valid receipt, why didn’t they check it out since they are able to go and look at our previous orders. They have looked at my previous orders many times where I did get my rewards/stars. Of course they could BE LAZY, or DON’T GIVE A CARE, or both.",
          "Spent almost $1,500 at Starbucks and didn’t gave me my rewards. Been a gold member on or before year 2011 but representative said there’s nothing they can do. I emailed the corporate 2 to 3 times but got nothing. What a poor communicator.",

Every time I receive an email for a challenge or promotion, I click on \"Activate the offer\" or \"Join the Dash.\" I always read the fine print, purchase the items required within the dates provided and then I wait for the promotion period to end. A week after that, I have to contact Starbucks to manually add my reward stars. How infuriating is that? Every single time! The same thing happens with my husband's card. He has to do the same thing, call or fill out the feedback form. Starbucks - get it together already, and give customers the rewards they signed up for!",

Sadly it happened—again...this time I received a card from a trusted friend and the same happened. I already texted her and let her know what had happened. I'm having a bad feeling Starbucks is having some kind of scam. I'm so appreciative of my friend’s kind heart and texted her about the card because I feel uncomfortable about what Starbucks is doing and personally I will not purchase Starbucks gift cards in the future, anymore.",

I suppose I should have assumed that they were going to rip me off with this triple charge and check my account and since I did not do that they decided to keep my money or offer me a card so that I lose my choice of where I spend the money that they stole.

I have been a loyal if not addicted daily customer gold member before there were apps......I have never been treated as poorly as this...and not to mention these ridiculous conditions at the time of purchase (on bottom of gift box in small print), really!!!!! The only thing I can do is stop going there (2,500 to 3,000 a year). Hey you get a few of us and maybe they will do something about it.",

I checked my Credit Card info online and discovered both credit cards had been charged.

Then Starbucks stopped the receipt upload for stars, so now I am boycotting Starbucks due to receipt upload ending and now buying from Black Rifle Coffee. Over the years Starbucks keeps chopping away at the loyalty star program. In the past you got way more star benefits but now it's super skimpy.",

So, out of curiosity, I checked the purchase history. I discovered the unauthorized deduction (total of $12.05) occurred in 2 different Starbucks stores. I asked the cashiers to redeem the rewards on food but evidently they deducted the value of the food from my card \"and\" redeemed my rewards. In a sense, I doubled paying them (real $$ and the rewards that I am entitled to use on food). I sent an email to its Customer Service and got an apology email of experience and an reimbursement of $12 only. I am very disappointed with the corporation. ",

I don't drink coffee, but decided to try to make the best of it and see if there was anything on their website to buy. I figured I'd go ahead and purchase some of their overpriced honey, just to use up the card. But after I went through all of the time and trouble on their unfriendly website to register, register the card, register for the store, etc. and jumped through all of those stupid hoops, I finally got to the checkout. I entered the long card number and pin, and it says cards can't be used right now because the site is down for maintenance. That was at 7pm yesterday. ",

The Starbucks Cafe we go to is in a Market32/Price Chopper grocery store. Previously, every now and then purchase history shows with the $ amount, but no stars, shows as 0.0 earned. Then this started happening on a frequent basis. Called customer service, most speak English with a very broken accent. Explained the issue. ",

No spin will change the facts that they are again making it more difficult to achieve reward benefits. Am now having 2nd thoughts about continuing to frequent Starbucks. Between unreasonable and uncompetitive prices and now reduced rewards will probably now go elsewhere.",
          "I am simply writing to vent my frustration in an attempt to get Starbucks' attention (futile though that effort may be). My Starbucks loyalty rewards card was deactivated this morning, a card that had a monetary value. The in-store staff have been great but because they cannot reactivate the card, they directed me to customer service. Customer service told me, among other things, that the card was deactivated because I was \"not compliant with the terms of use.\" Hmm. The in-store staff indicated that the change in terms that customer service referred to occurred about 2 years ago, but would not have affected my use of the card (that change apparently dealt with charges for extras).",
          "When I found out today about the new Starbucks reward program, I couldn't believe it. I guess I will be giving up my daily habit as it is not worth it anymore. They make the new program out to be better but it is a marketing tactic. When the new points system launches, customers will have to earn 300 stars -- or spend close to $150 -- to reach gold status. After that, they will need 125 stars (the equivalent to spending about $63) in exchange for a free item. That is completely ridiculous. I am not sure what Marketing person came out with this idea but I would fire them. They are getting the public pretty fired up about this new program. Makes me sad. I once really thought that Starbucks was a great company that cared about its customers, apparently not.",
          "I went into Starbucks in Aurora, CO with a coupon for a buy one get one free drink and they wouldn't honor the coupon. What's the point in even signing up for emails if they won't honor their coupons? The expiration date was for September 2014. I really enjoy giving you guys business every day. I just feel like it would be nice to be rewarded every once in a while.",

Customer service didn't know how to help. I've spent money to play the game trying to win prizes but never see the prizes that I've already won. FRAUD!!! Don't fall for it screenshots don't help either. It needs the reward to be displayed as in barcode scan. I'm not spending in Starbucks anymore. Its brand of integrity is very poor.",

Later on in the day, I realized this matter is pressing and they probably weren't going to get to my e-mail today, so I got back on and noticed the \"Need Help? Call 1800** for assistance. \" So I did.",
          "I had purchased a drink on my app at an airport. I went to pick it up and they said they could not make my drink because the blender was broken down and could not refund my money. I asked them how I would get my money back. They said there's a phone number on the app and the phone number goes to the store and I've called the store nine times and no one will answer.

          "I go to Starbucks often and this is the closest to my home. I most often drink iced coffee with milk. They almost always try to \"sweeten it.\" I never order it sweetened, I always say nothing else after placing my order. This is not what prompted this review. Yesterday morning at about 7am, I was excited to get a \"Free\" drink and use my card on my iPhone app (yes I go a lot). When I took out the coupon and was about to ask if I could get my usual (cheaper than the drink on the coupon), the barista said someone had mass produced the coupon so Starbucks was no longer accepting it? How can you stop using a coupon with a good date on it? I didn't want to be without coffee so I bought an iced coffee with milk and they got it right; but the guy in front of me brought his back because they added sweetener without asking. This is a newer Starbucks, but it has been there long enough to not worry about 1 cup of coffee vs. losing a customer.",

I didn't have time to call and get a new card so I just didn't use it. Also, your customer service is God awful and I am upset that I go to Starbucks every week to get a coffee, as well as, my wife and I am never able to get the point. Next, I was never able to use my card on my birthday because it would not register that I have a free birthday drink. Thanks for that. It's just disappointing that this company can give two ** about the customer. Thanks for the ** service over the years. Lastly, try to get employees that have a better outlook on life.

Seriously!!! This is how you treat a customer who spends thousands of dollars a year for coffee and food at their place! Never going back to Starbucks again, I don't want to deal with people like that when I need help! and it's not like I was asking for free stars or rewards, I pay my money and I want my stars to be added to my account!",

I asked her for verification from them that the charges were voided - she wouldn't. I asked for a manager and after five minutes on hold she hung up on me. I am so disappointed.

The lid was unsecured so when I went to pick it up, hot water spilled on my left hand & left a third-degree burn. Next day called the corporate office, the man said he would send me a 100 dollar gift card for the incident. I wait 2 months - NO CARD. Call corporate again, said they sent it to the wrong address, they verified my address and resent another card. 2 weeks later I receive it go to use it and card is locked so I call them again, they said they would correct it and add an additional $25 for my troubles. Come to find out they only put $25 instead of $125, so I call again the next agent corrected it. ",

Also, she couldn't tell me where the $55 transfer went to. Therefore, I escalated it to Shalene, supervisor, as I needed someone to resolve this charge in a more timely manner. She reiterated that since it was an online charge, it will take 7-10 business days to resolve it with my bank.",
          "I went to Starbucks website November 13 to order a gift card for my brother in another state. Easy, right? Many to choose from, easy steps... I put in his name and address, hit pay with Paypal, done. Less than five minutes. The auto-reply receipt came back within a seconds with the Bill-to address as me, but his address. There was no information on the receipt as to who they were shipping it to, so I wondered. What just happened? I called them immediately. ",
          "I then called and tried to activate and I was told that I needed to go to the location it was purchased to use??? First of all it's in a different state and I don't know what location. It sounds like a dumb business practice. Normally you get a gift card and you go to their location and use what money is on it. It was prob only $20.00 to $100.00 but who knows, the card is now TRASH. Very poor policy for such a large corp.",
          "I bought a $10 Starbucks card through Groupon on a promotion. I immediately started receiving Starbucks ads via email. Thus the probable reason for the promotion. But when I went to use it at my nearest Starbucks, located in a Target store, they could not confirm that it existed. I called Starbucks and they confirmed that I had the full amount on the card. They further said that NOT ALL Starbucks accepted the card, especially ones in retail stores. I needed to go to a stand-alone Starbucks to use it or transfer it to an existing card. My nearest stand-alone Starbucks is 24 miles away. While I like Starbucks, although grossly overpriced, this has left a bad taste in my mouth and I will hesitate to visit one in the future. I have already blocked all Starbucks emails.",
          "I know many gift cards are not refundable. But when there is a statement on the back of Starbucks gift card package as \"Refunds only provided for unused cards with the original receipt\" printed, I would expect there was a system in place to handle that. But I found that was not the case. I accidentally grabbed a gift card with wrong amount at Safeway. I tried to return it right away but Safeway said they did not give refunds for gift cards. I called Starbucks and was told Safeway should and I needed to talk to the store manager. Back at Safeway, I was told I needed to talk to Starbucks' customer service manager. Starbucks should change its policy to \"Gift cards are NOT refundable.\"",

They told me I had not refreshed my card on the internet. Now I've looked at that balance on several different internet screens, so I'm not sure what they are saying. On the iPhone passbook it still shows the $27.93 balance, but nowhere else. What happened to it? They said I didn't have a balance.",

I love the quality of the oatmeal I always get so I was so disappointed in the poor quality of the sandwich. There was also no ketchup. With the high prices and supposed guarantee of high quality Starbucks claims to have, they should have fancy ketchup. Something at least to mask that fake egg taste. However... The coffee is always delicious. I'll just stick with that from now on.",
          "I tried reloading my Starbucks card using their mobile app, it did not go through. No error, no nothing. It just keeps pointing me back to the log-in information. So, I tried it a couple more times, still unsuccessful. I tried to use a different card and still doing the same. At this point, I decided to give up and just let the barista load the card for me. It went through with no problem. When I got home, I checked my online account and found out I was charged 6 times. I called Starbucks, the agent told me it was a known issue and they will release the hold after 2 days. I contacted my credit card company to find out if they can release the hold faster. They can but they need a Starbucks representative to call them.",
          "I downloaded the Starbucks App for the first time earlier today, and I did not realize that they automatically had me choose to purchase a Starbucks Card service, and they automatically uploaded $25.00 from my debit card into the Starbucks Card account. I bought one tall size cold brew today which it cost $3.40 which leave me a total of $21.60 in remaining balance. I called later today to cancel this scam Starbucks Card service, and they will only refund me $20.00 back to my debit card. ",
          "I went to Starbucks online site and my password wasn't recognized. I followed their directions and changed my password. The site recognized the change until I used it. Had to change the password 4 times. Finally, I phoned the company. Their response, \"Your account has been closed for 24 hrs.\" I bought a $40 tumbler last week, collect only Starbucks cups, buy coffee to brew at home and stop in 3 or 4 days a week to buy coffee. Thank you Starbucks! You're a real winner.",
          "I trusted Starbucks and stored over $700 on my three Starbucks cards to earn reward points. On Nov 18, 2019 I received an email from Starbucks saying I requested to change my account password. I didn't. Feeling suspicious, I checked my Starbucks account and found that my balance is $50. I thought my account got hacked and someone stole my money. I called Starbucks to report it. They said Starbucks cancelled two of my cards and took away my money. No reason was given. No emails explaining what happened, or why it happened. Like all this wasn't enough they told me on the phone they are taking the remaining $50 balance and I have to file a complaint to get my money back. This all seemed unreal to me and hard to believe. Starbucks decided to take away my money and I have to complain to them to get it back.",
          "I recently purchased two $100 Starbucks gift cards off of eBay from two separate owners. I received them, consolidated them onto a single card and even transferred my own funds from another registered card onto this card. All amounts were there and all was good. I went to use my Starbucks gift card (with a $214.02 balance) on the morning of 3/27/14 and was told the account was closed! You can how I felt! I got right on the phone with Starbucks customer service and was told that this account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I asked for details so I could research with my sellers on eBay and they provided nothing. I notified both eBay sellers...One took it upon themselves to contact Starbucks directly and was informed by Starbucks that it was not his card that was fraudulent but the other $100 that was illegal. The second seller was very receptive and refunded my purchase amount within the day.",
          "Tried to reload my rewards card. Twice, Starbucks \"declined\" my transactions. Therefore, went to a physical location to reload my account. Moron at the drive-thru ran my card for $50+$9.23=$59.23. Checked my Starbucks account balance. It showed a balance of $40.77. Really? So, I check my bank account to see what the problem was. Bank account shows three separate charges at $50 a piece. Starbucks charged my account +$150 for one stupid, simple transaction.",
          "If I could only give the corporate office “0” stars I would. Whenever I would send them a request for my stats or/and a qualified purchase, I would get it. During the time of this post, I did purchase a grande iced caramel macchiato which is a qualified macchiato purchase. I sent them my receipt where I did get my stars. BUT (a big but), they claim this isn’t a qualifying purchase. I did purchase a hot caramel macchiato earlier in the day. But I accidentally threw the receipt away (my fault).  ",

I, of course, complied and Chase says I got my 4500 rewards but NOTHING In my Starbucks account. I called, emailed in April and again yesterday. BOTH TIMES A COMPLETE RUN AROUND. Chase blames Starbucks, and Starbucks blames Chase. I'M SICK AND TIRED of this runaround. Chase rep even told me to call STarbucks' Rewards \"Elevation team\" and even HE SAID it was Chase's fault and there is nothing he can do. WHAT THE **. I'm tired. Sick of this runaround.

          "On 01/23/2023 I purchased Starbucks beverage located in Las Vegas. Upon receiving the beverage (Caramel Macchiato), it was drowned in Caramel Sauce. Caramel was thrown in the cup and to top it off an excessive amount of Caramel was put on top. I requested the beverage to be made again. Upon departing property, I realized that the steaming wand was never wiped down. I returned home and contacted Starbucks via email to leave a complaint. I was contacted back and was informed that I would be receiving a full refund for the purchase. On 02/04/2023, I received the gift card through Mail. Looked to see how much was refund and showed, 10 cents. Due to the lack customer service, I will be taking my business elsewhere.",
          "I called on 2/3/17 due to accidentally deleting one of the cards with a just reloaded balance on my phone app while still trying to figure out how to use the app. I was in the store and had receipts for just reloading the card that was accidentally deleted ($25). The employee was unable to help, even though they knew exactly what had happened, but said to call the store with my receipt. After calling about this to the 1-800 number, the customer service agent did research and I was on hold at least 30 minutes. They were able to see the money and the card that was reloaded and said they would sent out a card with the money I had just reloaded. ",
          "I contacted Starbucks customer service to ask why they only give one day to redeem their free drink for the birthday promotion. I wasn't able to use the free drink promotion on the one day allowed. I've been a customer for over 11 years and all they stated was, \"Sorry, our policy has changed, have a nice day\". I then contacted customer service online again to see how to cancel my membership card. I ended up calling and speaking with a representative. She took my information down and said I still have 34 cents on the card. I told her to keep it and just cancel the membership card. She stated, that's fine and the card will be deleted immediately. There was never a question why I'm canceling the card because obviously, I was upset. ",

          "For a week now I've been unable to order because the shopping cart is literally broken, and according to each person I've dealt with, it has something to do with PayPal. I cannot delete items from the shopping cart. The shopping cart broke when I selected PayPal; \"null, null, null\" is now printed in my payment method. No one at Starbucks has been able to fix the problem; I've tried email, chat, and phone support. No one has a solution; the script message about cookies and cache is bogus. The first question each person asked was if the purchase was attempted through PayPal. I've logged into my account from multiple devices, changed passwords (I'll say too easily), and somehow none of the items can be removed from the shopping cart, and no purchase method can be selected anymore.

          "Double Charged - No Refund - No Accountability. Last Friday, January 12th, 2018, around 630 AM (PST) I bought my wife a Starbucks E-Giftcard. The amount was for $15.00. I have done this a few times prior and every purchase was without fault. Had my wife not called me and told me thanks for the gift card(s) I would have been none the wiser. I checked my emails and sure enough she was right. For some reason it duplicated my order. That means it charged me twice. I checked my bank account and it confirmed a double charge. I get it, mistakes happen. Obviously a system error. I called the phone # on the email and went through their horrible automated system that takes like 5 minutes to navigate. After locating the right department I was on hold for about 5 minutes just to hear the representative say I reached the wrong department.",
          "Starbucks sent me an email for the happy hour frappuccino. 3pm to 5 pm for everyone and if you're a member, you get an additional hour, which by the way I am. When it came time to pay, I was charged regular price. I said it was not 6 o'clock yet. The cashier told me it was for gold card members only. Nowhere in the email I received said anything about been a gold member only in order to get the extra hour. So I asked them to show me where does it say gold card members only. Unable to prove such thing, they gave me the special. This was the 3rd and last incident I had with Starbucks #6800 at 13102 Goldenwest St Westminster CA. I will not visit them again.",

          "I filed a BBB complaint last month because Starbucks canceled my Starbucks Reward cards. I couldn't remember the balances, so I guessed about $9. Starbucks played nothing but games and tried everything they could to avoid responding to the complaint. I received a couple of phone call messages asking me to contact them directly and discuss the matter. The number provided was the customer service number and when I spoke with one representative, Linda hung up the phone on me. I did not use my card since 2012 which is my prerogative. Because of this and other reasons, Starbucks decided to close my Starbucks account. I reopened one about a few weeks ago and added a new card that I have not used yet.",
          "My mother sent me a $15 gift card purchased from Walgreens in June. She came to visit me this past weekend and brought the Gift card receipts. I contacted Walgreens to replace the cards. I was told to contact the Merchant (Starbucks). I called Starbucks and spoke with a representative today, explained my problem. He asked for the card number. When I provided it, he transferred me to a different department that handles these issues. I got another representative. I told this representative why I was transferred over. She got silent and ended the call. It is like no one wants to handle issues or do their job. ",
          "I received my bank statement and noticed two back to back unauthorized charges for 50 dollars each. I have called Starbucks over ten times to get this resolved. Three times they hung up on me. The rest were a mix of random options, none of which has seen my money returned. I don't drink coffee nor have I ever had a Starbucks card. They have said that my bank has to do a recharge for the amount, when asked why they could not do it, they responded by saying they do not have my credit card info. I attempted to provide it they said no. I asked them how did they take my money and not have my info.",
          "ONLINE STORE IS USELESS. You can only call Mon.-Fri. 8 a.m.-5 p.m -- terrible customer service. Takes 10 days before they ship the order. Now they are using lowest level of delivery, takes 7-10 days to arrive. They are continually out of stock on items. Emails are not answered promptly. When they do answer they tell you it will ship and then it doesn't.",

I never received an email telling me that the order was shipped and when I kept checking their website to see when it was coming, there was nothing showing, not even my order. Surprisingly, I received it on 1/23. It did not work. No water was coming through the machine. I tried going on their website to see if there was any troubleshooting information. There was nothing listed for the problem. I then called the company to see if there was any information that I could get to solve the problem. The representative that answered the phone did not offer any helpful information, so she said that I could send it back for either a replacement or refund. I chose to send it back for a refund. I sent it back on the 24th. Since I didn't see anything back from the company giving me a status for the refund, I just called the company today. ",

How is it possible for such bad customer service for such a huge company?",

My Visa CSR informed me that \"a lot of stolen credit card numbers (not physical cards) are used to reload Starbucks cards\".

After two Christmases in a row it sold out in local cafes and I was unable to meet special orders. So I made up a fresh batch, boxed it up nicely and decorated the packages.

I decided to travel overseas and walked into a Starbucks in Bangkok and presented my card for payment. It was not accepted!!! Starbucks cards are ONLY good in the country they are issued in!

After several calls Starbucks said first that it was sent and then another rep said they only gave it to a few people and a third said they don't see our order even though we had confirmation numbers from Starbucks. It is false advertising and a scam. The reps will not help us or give us our money back. Visa checkout won't help either because they said it's Starbucks' problem not theirs. Isn't false advertising against the law? Hate Starbucks and will not go there ever again. I just want my hard earned money back for me and my son.",

          "I'm sure you've heard a lot of feedback on the Stars program, but I want to point out two very important things (to me) about what you have done to your loyal customers. First, the new Stars program makes it more difficult and certainly more expensive to achieve rewards. Before the change, my go-to beverage cost me $4.62 (ridiculous) and earned me one star. Every 12th beverage was free, making the cost for before the free reward (assuming I ordered the same thing most times) $50.82. Again, ridiculous. ",
          "Starbucks rewards program is a total joke. I have been a loyal customer for years. Lately I’ve found out that the offers they send out to customers for bonus stars are really a slap in the face to regular customers and favor the rare or occasional customers. I received an offer to receive 50 bonus stars for six consecutive days of purchases while my daughter who rarely uses Starbucks received the same offer but for 100 bonus stars for six consecutive days of purchases. To me this says “we can take advantage of you because you are loyal and we will try to lure in the ones who aren’t loyal by giving them a better deal”. All I can say is I feel a real craving for Dunkin' coming on. Starbucks doesn’t deserve my money or my loyalty.",

I was told this time that new policy is to send out a new card. Ok... now I got to wait even after 3-5 days for a card to be mailed to me! Each time the incident has happened I have been told a different story. Not only do I have to call Starbucks to remind them that they don’t give me my bonus points... I have to call them to see where my money disappears!! App sucks. Starbucks sucks.",

          "My child's teacher LOVES Starbucks coffee. So at the end of this school year (2015-2016), on June 2 to be exact, I bought a Starbucks' gift card for my child's teacher. I had asked the cashier to put 100.00 on the gift card. The cashier charged me 200.00 instead. Sadly, I didn't realize it until the following day when I checked my bank account and noticed the amount, at which point, I checked the receipt and surely, it was for 200.00. I then called the store to inform them of the incorrect charge. They were very helpful...but unfortunately, I was doomed because now I had to experience the lovely method of which Starbucks provides customer service via their 800 helpline.",
          "I've been a loyal, daily customer until recently. I had loaded a $50 gift card from a third party bringing my balance to $85. After accepting the card transfer, something went wrong and instead of just removing the $50 in question, they closed my account and took my entire $85 balance. I was told that even if I loaded my card with $499 in cash and had used a bad card for $1, they would take the entire $500! I asked several times for my $35 and was told no. I know it's not a lot of money, but it is the principle. I'm not sure if that practice is legal, but I know it is highly UNETHICAL.",
          "I tried to cancel my mobile app. After 30 minutes I was informed that they would refund part of the money. The customer service rep said that part of the money could not be refunded. When I originally got the app there was no statement that part of the funds would be non refundable.",

          "I was sent an email from Starbucks again for a NEW promotion for Spring For Stars, April 14 - 20. Watch your email for each day's special offer. First offer was 3 bonus stars on any Iced Latte drink. According to Starbucks, \"Use this as many times as you like\". I did use it 3 times throughout the day on April 14th. I got 1 star for each transaction, but NO bonus stars. I called Starbucks at their 800 number and they have no record of this promotion in their database. Yet, I have been sent 3 emails on this promotion. Starbucks gives away FREE education to their employees, BUT does not want to give bonus stars for promotions. Now I see how they are paying for the FREE education.",
          "I go in frequently for myself but I also bring coffee and pastries to my clients. I often get played games about the amount of money I have on my account. The entire rewards program is a joke - free drinks on your birthday and the earning of stars! I spend $150-$250 per month in personal and business use. I called Starbucks corporate office and got treated terrible. I was shocked. Port City Java you just earned yourself a new customer. Thanks.",
          "2) Starbucks has continuously cut their rewards program over the past few years. Now, you have to ‘activate’ double star days. They know the more trouble they put people through, the less people will get the benefit.",
          "The fact that you don’t even allow a one week grace period to use Birthday rewards now is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard and it’s not right. Starbucks is so money hungry now that you don’t even let me decide when I can go get my free coffee. What’s next? Are you going to have to use your regular rewards the day you get them after you’ve already gotten coffee that day? The way Starbucks ruins the free rewards more and more every year is making me dislike Starbucks as a company and makes me never want to go there again.",
          "All the money Starbucks makes not only are they ungrateful to their employees but what's the point of being a loyal ongoing cu6 when you have to pay more just to start using rewards, why would they change the amount you need to earn? It's bad enough all their Starbucks games you don't win anything big. It's like they are all rigged that way...Not to win.",
          "I purchased 2 slices of cake and 1 had plastic in the middle. I called Starbucks customer service and was told I could be helped because I ain’t have a Starbucks account. Ask for the rep name. Told her to give me district manager name and give him my information and she told me I’ll be better off taking back to the store and hung up on me. I have pictures. How can I upload them? I always love Starbucks cakes but now my brain not going to allow me to eat their cakes anymore. Starbucks customers service rep sucks. Treated me like I was not a paying customer.",
          "HALF THE TIME I DON'T GET BONUS STARS LIKE I SHOULD...And have to call Starbucks customer service. After wasting about 35 minutes each time, I might get the stars I earned. Starbucks is expensive, and purchasing the drinks required to earn rewards will quickly mount up. I've decided to blow off their stupid bonus star challenges and only go to Starbucks if and when I desperately need an espresso.",
          "My account got blocked, I cannot log in and I have a substantial balance there. I have already spent hours on the phone with customer service trying to resolve this. The issue was even \"escalated\" to a senior rep. But after months of going back and forth and me bagging to return my money, Starbucks reps say that there's nothing they can do. They wouldn't issue me a card for the balance or credit me back on my credit card.",
          "Last Wednesday, someone compromised my Starbucks card and bought 62 $100 gift cards, which went into my bank account via PayPal. Fortunately or not, I don't keep $6000+ in my account, so it was overdrawn. Everyone except Starbucks has handled this wonderfully. PayPal customer service and my credit union (BECU) have gone out of their way to be generous. Not Starbucks. I called on the morning. I discovered the fraud and opened a case. The person I spoke with said someone would call me. I called back four hours later and was told someone would contact me within 3-4 business days, and the issue would be resolved within 7-10 business days. At that point, I requested a manager and was denied - literally told “no, you can't speak with a manager until our investigation is complete.”",
          "When Starbucks changed the \"rewards\" to \"stars\", they eliminated the unlimited free purchases, now if you order more than one item, you don't get the discount on multiple purchases, as you did with the old \"rewards\" program, and there was no notice of any kind advising that the unlimited free purchase had been either planned or discontinued. Matter of a fact when I complained to Starbucks about this bait & switch, all I got was a bunch of mumbo jumbo double speak legalese, it appears that Starbucks MO is now screw the customer, they apparently haven't learned anything from their last two publicity failures. Buyer BEWARE, use up your star rewards as fast as you can.",

It amazes me that they refuse to make it everyday. Last week, I counted twice out of 7 days that it was an option. This store has 2 girls that run circles around this hack manager they hired. It's like she's (manager) is doing us a favor having cold brew ice coffee twice a week. They just opened a new store about 3 miles away. A lot of customers are heading that way. Don't even let me get started on the 100 yard line on the weekends. If I was the manager's boss, she'd be ** carriages at a supermarket without hesitation.",

On the morning of July 29th 2015 I went to order my coffee at the location listed. ** was the one working at the cash register and when I ordered I told her that I would use a free one in which I had earned on my app. She was horribly rude and disrespectful. I had noticed this behavior before and I told her that I was not going to tolerate her disrespect no more. She went off and started yelling and went over to another co-worker and then they both started yelling and creating a scene. The acting manager told her to quiet down although she continued. ",

When I complained and ask to speak to the manager, he told that he was the manager. I was so angry I walked away. I will never step foot in a Starbucks again. If this how they thank their customers then they don't need my money. It already is ridiculously expensive. So I will be going to Seven Eleven!!!!",

I waited for two cars to enter and I proceeded to enter. This mad lady came from behind me. Literally drove my car off the line violently and this lady name Bianca who works at this location who hasn't seen how crazy this woman push me out off the way. Almost crashing me with her car.

I call the number from the sticker and told me the attendant will be there shortly (took 45 minutes for him to come!!). Complain to the Starbucks manager and he said that is Starbucks policy that you can't leave the parking lot and we have plenty of sign for that!!!

Several people came in after her, ordered their drinks and left before she received her drink. After I dropped her off at school, I contacted this Starbucks to find out what happened. The lady I spoke with seemed uncaring and unconcerned about the situation. She stated that the cups may have gotten out of order, she wasn't making the drinks and she did not know. Not once in the conversation did she apologize or sound as if she cared. ",

Today they left the an ingredient out of my caramel white Mocha so it didn't taste right. I do not believe this is a mistake. Instead they cheated me in a petty act of retribution for reasons unknown to me. They may have a personal problem with me, I don't know, I am a frequent customer but even if they don't like me that is no excuse for their unprofessional and childish behavior. I am only guessing at the reasons for their rudeness but it is worse every time I come in. I am assuming it is personal but whether it is or not I doubt that I'm the only customer with a problem with them. This sort of staff problem always starts at the top with the store manager.",

We were sitting minding our own business trying to have a personal conversation and she went off. She is always rude and has a attitude. I used to go there all the time but not anymore. And we had to call the police because it was total harassment. She was so out of line and we told her to just stop yelling and go away and that made her more mad. We have never been treated so bad by anyone anywhere in our lives. We smoke outside by the ashtray and so do the police when they come have coffee and we know all of them because our father was a cop in that area. Making a corporate complaint for being harassed.",

I said, \"Don't you think you owe me an apology for their mistake?\" He said he owed me nothing and told me to leave the store. We have been going to that location since it has been opened. We spend on the average $200 to $300 per month with Starbucks. Needles to say, that came to a halt as of today.

The employee at the cash register was a woman who repeated over and over that she is in her fifties (years old). She was extremely loud and rude to us in front of all the many other customers. I asked her for two cold matcha lattes, no ice. She said our drinks would be this far from the top of the cup and she held her fingers up to show about a couple inches. I asked her why. She said in a very loud annoyed tone, “because the ice makes up part of the drink and if you have no ice, then that’s how much less drink you get.” Then she said, in a very annoyed loud tone again, “otherwise you have to get more milk and I have to charge you more for that.”",

Still, she had every thing right but the vanilla, so when she asked me if it was right, I said \"Everything but the vanilla.\" She said she was having trouble hearing me, so I said loudly \"Va-nil-la!\" She said she was still having trouble hearing me, and for some unknown reason changed the drink to a grande vanilla latte, so I said loudly \"Moch-a!\" and then asked her why she changed the drink/size? She said she more about not being able to hear me, so in a very loud voice I said \"SHORT... DECAF... VANILLA... MOCHA.. NONFAT...

So, we stopped in by going out the door at the hospital. We did not have to stand there for long and we tried the regular coffee. I got my Starbucks coffee with cream and my husband got his coffee black. We went outside and started to drink the coffee and my husband started saying how bad it was. I told him this is the best then I took a drink and it was the worst coffee I had ever drunk in my life. I would have never given the coffee away and I sure would not have charged anyone for it. I would have taken it back but we were getting on the bus to go to the garage parking lot. The coffee tasted like it was burned and it was so bitter that it made us sick just tasting it. It made me angry because we paid so much money for coffee like this and had to trash it.",

My order was placed for a venti sized blonde roast of brewed coffee, including eight packages of agave, sugar free vanilla, cream and the two boxes discussed above.",
          "I have a Starbucks card that I reload faithfully. So I make frequent visits to Starbucks, and I have for many years. I have never felt the need to make a complaint. A young female barista went out of her way to be rude to me at 4505 Peoria in Denver on Thursday, Oct. 29th at around 4:10 p.m. She ignored me when I approach the counter. She was joking around with a male customer. She did not greet me. She curtly asked what she could do for me. So I smiled and said hi. She did not respond. And it just got worse from there. It was as if she was trying to hurt my feelings! But I did not react.",
          "I went into Starbucks and ordered a milk, brownie, frap, and blueberry muffin on April 6, 2012 at 9:55 am. The cashier was not very friendly. I left. When I got home, I noticed she forgot my muffin and I drove all the way back to the store. I let the cashier (Tahisha) know that she forgot my muffin and she looked at me like it was my fault. When she went to grab the muffin (there were only 2 left), I asked her for the one towards the front, to which she let out a loud sigh. She gave me the muffin without saying a word the whole time I was there, without an \"I'm sorry\" and not even a \"Here you go.” I took my muffin in silence and did not say, \"Thank you.” ",
          "I recently spoke with a manager at Starbucks concerning employment. I was told that they do not hire people of my age because they cannot remember the recipes. I believe that is age discrimination. I laughed at first but realized the young man was serious. He did take my name and phone number. I think that maybe you should train your managers about the law of discrimination. Regardless of my age, I am capable of remembering recipes and doing the job. My sister did post this on Facebook and many people responded with saying I should bring about a lawsuit against you. What do you think? Feels a lawsuit is order due to age discrimination.",
          "I visit various Starbucks stores in my neighborhood of Del Mar, CA virtually every afternoon for an ice tea and a moment of relaxation to read and research. I am a well-known international businessman with an excellent reputation. Yesterday, while siting on the patio of the Del Mar Heights store (3485 Del Mar Heights Rd Ste A3, San Diego, CA 92130-2125) I was verbally accosted by both the store manager (**) and a man that I understood was an employee of Starbucks. The manager was in the midst of filing a report with a security guard at the shopping center when I walked up and asked if they were aware of an incident that I just experienced outside. The manager then said that I was “a ** old ** man, a ** and that I go there every afternoon hoping to get “lucky.”",
          "I have never been so rudely spoken to in such a matter that I left without my drink I was coming into get from your Starbucks in Camp Verde, AZ by Tracy **.  She scolded me as if I was a child or the way I have heard her speak to her employees.  I have been a daily customer for 6 years and spend about $100.00 a week in this Camp Verde location.  Since the new manager has come to this location, it's not been the same.  Please relocate this so called manager or give her the proper training to deal with customers.  If she is unhappy with her employees, she should not take it out on customers.  All, and I mean all the employees at this Starbucks are simply amazing people who love their jobs and treat all customers with patience and tolerance.  I am so upset with the way we were talked to that I do not know if I can go back to this location while Tracy ** is working there.  Please, for the local people, get rid of her.  Send her to training in a big city where she must came from.  Thanks.",
          "My iPad was stolen from Starbucks Egypt (Soil Man Abaya branch) while being there on Friday, Feb. 24th. around 5 p.m. While I was sitting and studying. Upon asking the manager to retrieve the camera, he answered that they don't have a camera! I'm so disappointed as it has got all my data and work. Also I should be sitting in a reputable place.",
          "Because the incompetent manager, **, at store no. 6723 does not like me, she called a cop on me and told the cop lies about me and said I was barred from the store and the other Starbucks in the district. Since when does a store manager dictate the policies for the district? On that same day, she served me coffee and a brownie a half hour before the cop showed up. She set me up. Before that happened, I was regular loyal customer, and I told my friends and relatives about this incident. They are going to cut up their gold cards.The worst part of this was that the fool manager and the cop yelled at me to get out of the store and the idiot cop did not want to hear my side. I was humiliated in front of the employees and the customers, and that moron, the district manager, won't help me and she loves her. I believe nobody at Starbucks will help me. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise that people find out about this horrible company, because there are better coffee companies out there.",
          "This time this girl named KP was taking my order and when I ask her about discount she was so rude about it and she is like \"There is no button on screen that I can give you discount.\" I told her \"We always get discount\" but she was like \"There is no discount. I never saw you before.\" and she was very rude when she was talking to me.",
          "Staff at the Smythe St. Superstore location in Fredericton, NB often seen tired but today, a woman named Senoa (Senora?) was morose, glum, uncommunicative (even after I tried to engage her to sympathize, as there was obviously a bad mood happening), scruffy looking, almost rude. And, the Americano I ordered tastes watery. I go to Starbucks for a treat after a long day. It a difficult experience, to ease stress and have a pleasant experience. I’m going to sell a different location after today’s grumpy girl.",
          "Asked staff question. Was very rude and snappy. Same with other customers...acted like they were doing us a favor being there...puts a very poor image of your company. Last time I will go to this location.",
          "I went to Starbucks in Indiana state (Henry Schricker travel plaza; store code 0403907) in 9/30/14 at 8:19 am. I ordered Ice caramel macchiato, cheese danish and juice Naked for a total $13.42. I paid by cash. I gave to cashier (her name **, her ID #**) $100 bill (only bill that I had). She gave my change $56.58 (the change suppose to be $86.58). I took money I started to count my change in front of her and told her that she gave me not enough, that she suppose to give me $30 more. Her answer kill me: \"I gave you all change; you lost it.\" I told her that I was not going anywhere, I was staying in front of her waiting for the order. She said that if I can't handle my money, it is my problem. I was in shock. Then I asked manager. \"The manager\" came right away. She even did not asked what was the problem. She took my change, took all money from the cashier, went on the back somewhere. And few minutes later they came back, gave me $46 (but took $56), and told me that their cashier has no extra money; everything is fine. ",
          "I always go to the Starbucks in Oakland, on Hegenberger, and I've never really had an issue with service until last night! The Barista ** was rude to me and my children! She seemed very detached from her responsibilities and ability to be friendly. Usually when I come, I only see two girls, ** and **, who are both very sweet and willing to do what it takes to satisfy me and kids. ** always puts a really big smile on my kids’ faces and mine. She's a really sweet girl. Unfortunately she was off tonight. But last night, my kids asked for pastries and ** (\"Person in charge?\") ignored my son, due to her deep concern with texting. She never even acknowledged him standing there. ** later helped him. I studied for some time to overhear the night shift complaining about the job to a guy who came in. If she hates her own manager and the way she's treated here, why not quit? It will probably do us good customers some justice! ",
          "We had to correct them on our order 3 times. They never got it right then the manager came over to us and said we made her employee uncomfortable because we were trying to correct our order.

          "CHK: **, TIME: 04:58 PM, **, Drawer: 1 Reg. On Jan 24, 2016, I had gone with my friend to Starbucks at 805 North Pine Street, Spartanburg, SC - ordered 3 coffee. The server was busy \"chatting\" with her colleagues and didn't pay any attention to what we were requesting - finally got our 3 hot coffee. Did she not have a clue to give a tray to hold the hot coffee or ask if we needed? She didn't bother to give an insulator for the hot coffee. Maybe when she is at work, instead of chatting, she can focus on what she is there for? I can send the image of receipt if asked for.",
          "I went to my corner Starbucks at #7612, 1st Ave. & 60th street in NY. As usual, no smiles from the morning crew. But today, a particularly rude cashier by the name of ** had the nerve to interrupt my conversation with the person behind me when I told that person that this was the worst Starbucks in the neighborhood. He espoused very sarcastically how sorry he was and proceeded to talk back to me all the way through my transaction. The girl working behind him was using her cell phone while working, and the others were looking cross at every customer that walked in. Absolutely the worst customer service! This is sad. I have already complained to their management, but it seems that Starbucks has a monopoly here in NYC as they are literally on every corner!",
          "I live right across the street from Starbucks, the same Starbucks I spend $8.00 to $13.00 dollars a day at. The kids work hard at serving people. I tip them very good, sometimes I walk through not buying anything and throw couple of dollars in the tip box. I walked in today May 21st bought a cup coffee left a tip and sat down in the chair and plug my cell phone in, then an elderly lady walked in with the backpack and said she wanted to sit in the table next to me and needed to plug her computer in the outlet where I had just plugged in. I explained, \"Miss I just bought a couple coffee and sat down plugged in I'm so sorry\". She walked around with a pissed off look on her face, (you can tell she didn't have both orders in the water).",

I don't believe that they are all the same.” She got mad and took the tongs, scraping off the frosting, and stuffed the cake in the bag. Then, she began to talk about me to another employee. Bad customer service. Very rude.",

While taking our orders I found she being upset or rude, unable to judge at that time. I took it easy. Then order placed, we were asked to wait for few minutes. We Sat in a table and waited, watching ** doing some coffee making process. We got the tea ordered, waited again, but never got the cookies and scones. Again we waited. Customers who came after us were served, So I went to the counter and told about the wait.",

He continues to laugh and do the things that he does. I refuse to see this man's face or to let up on Starbucks or the DR and Dr Office here in Colorado until they do something about this man's sick pedophile ways. They brought up a review at one point and since he is buddy, buddy with the manager it was swept under the rug.

          "188th St Starbucks in Fresh Meadows, NY - I bought coffee at this Starbucks and I was sitting at my table. A psycho basically panhandled me and wanted my seat. I refused to give up my seat and she threatened to \"** me up\" unless I give her my chair. She also cursed at other customers. The management was too stupid to ask her to leave or know how to deal with the situation. Perhaps one or two employees dealt with the situation properly. Only one employee apologized. I am disgusted, because they could have asked this psycho blonde girl to leave. They could have also banned her. They treat people with disrespect and in a discriminatory manner.",
          "Went to the Starbucks in Newport News' Tech Center (VA) and had the worst customer service by the rudest manager and employee. The manager is lazy and the subordinate co-signs her foolishness. Neither of them would walk 10 feet to let me know which item was mine after they put it with the walk up orders without a name (my name was not taken) and then kept yelling for me to \"get it from down there\" after I asked \"Which one is mine?\" This exchange went back and forth before the subordinate finally walked all the way to the area to figure out which one was mine - after I asked if they just wanted me to pick up whichever one I felt like taking. Rude. Lazy. Ridiculous. If this post doesn't make sense it's because the entire experience did not make sense. At all.",
          "I recently began purchasing coffee each morning at Starbucks at 'The River' mall in Rancho Mirage CA. The staff is completely incompetent and so I presume also the management as well. I am a 51 year old business major so I think I'm qualified to make this critique. One woman with curly grey hair particularly annoys me with her arrogance and flippant demeanor towards me. I ask for creamer or what the flavors of coffee are because a half hour after they open there are no signs on the coffee of the day board. She acts like I kicked her dog or something. Another woman tells me on Sunday when they're supposed to open at 5:30 that she's sorry but a manager failed to show up that morning. I have to think this an untruth because I know of no manager that shows up at 5:00 am on a Sunday. If competent help were available I see no need for a manager to be there. And if not, yet another poor service from this coffee shop. ",
          "Yesterday, I went to Starbucks for what I thought was going to be a relaxing cup of coffee. I planned on meeting my friend there and having a relaxing time. Well it didn't go as planned because, I parked in the handicapped spot (no I didn't have a handicapped sticker) and I was standing on line when a store associate in front of everyone stood in the middle of the store and loudly said “Is that your car in the handicapped spot?” and I responded “Yes” He says “Can you move it?” I said “no” and I began explaining why when another store associate (female) began getting loud and telling me I had to move it. I said I was not moving my car because they pick and choose when they want to enforce this rule and when it’s convenient for them. I continued to say if you’re going to enforce a rule it needs to be enforced all the time not just when it’s convenient to enforce. ",
          "I generally receive great service at that Starbucks. Natalie is awesome!! However, this morning I received the worst service from a Starbucks store yet! Scratch that... The worst customer service I've received from anyplace in while. The young boy at the cashier's (Danny **) was extremely rude, sarcastic and refused to accommodate my requests (which is just how I order my drink). Even if he could not accommodate my requests, (though all his coworkers always do) he could have declined in a friendly tone. As a frequent Starbucks customer I explained my concerns to him and that my drink is never a problem at any other stores or even there, when he is not the one at the cashiers- he said he could go get the manager or I could go have a nice day. Even if I were asking for the most difficult drink in the world, his lack of customer service and sarcasm were not appropriate. ",

My friend and I met there for coffee and lunch, as we often used to do, BUT NO MORE. We were encouraged to stay longer and have another drink only to be fined for overstaying the car parking by 15 mins. YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO STAY FOR more than 90mins and that is out of the car park within 90 mins. I visited the store and they said appeal the fine, I did this, the parking company refused the appeal as they only care about getting money and just threatened me with charging more and taking me to court. DO NOT go to Starbucks. You are ONLY ALLOWED to stay in the cafe for less than 90 min or they FINE YOU £100.",
          "I have never been as dissatisfied with Starbucks. I am a regular. Every day, I purchase coffee - and sometimes twice a day. Every once in while, I purchased the large Frappuccino and have it split it into 2 small cups. However, this time the new girl refused to do it. She was very rude. I don’t know what her problem was and why she took her unhappiness out on me and my young child. All I know is that my daughter started crying. I have never had this problem in the Bellevue, NE location. This girl should not be working at Starbucks from what my daughter says. Other than this unhappy girl, the service has always been excellent. Please address this situation.",
          "I frequent this particular Starbucks about 5 times a week. This is the Edgemont Branch location. My usual drink is grande in venti cup, extra milk. Most of the employees know my face and some know my name as I go there quite often. Today I went to get my usual drink. I know exactly how much coffee and how much milk goes into the cup. The coffee level is at the edge of the circle on the cup. So when I saw the amount of coffee was less than usual and had too much room, I pointed it to the employee. She then proceeded to go to the back to talk to someone else, then came back with a measured cup and said we can't do that and talked to me in a way that really ruined the experience for me as she was making a fuss over nothing.

It prob took at least 12 min to get to window. I was greeted by a young coffee barista. She took my money, gave my change back, was very friendly and then... it happened. I sat for 7 min waiting for my venti Caramel macchiato skinny. Not being a coffee barista I saw a line of coffees waiting on drive through counter. I was wondering why she didn't give me my coffee. I tried getting her attention but nothing. 7 min later she opened the window to ask me what I ordered. I almost blew a gasket. My coffee was sitting there the whole time. She allowed me to vent gave me my coffee. I drove off to realize it was warm ahhh. ",

This occurred at STARBUCKS on 10th/MARKET St. A young Asian kid licked his tongue at me as if I'm some kind of woman after I questioned him staring at me. Gut-sicken by this. They also had panhandlers and an \"exciting crowd\" causing confusion and chaos as if it was I being betted on at a race track!

I was taken back after I witnessed the manager with a poor display of customer service. He had made the lady's drink in front of me wrong for the second time. When she asked him if the shots had made it into her drink.he snapped back at her and said, \"Yes, I made it the way I always do. Did you brush your teeth this morning?\" I was blown away by how unprofessional he was. This wasn't the first time I've seen him be rude to his customers which is why I feel I need to say something.",

But then I noticed one of the guys hitting on me, constantly, that's when I decide to tell him I was straight. Well, from then on it was like, the training slowed down, nobody wanted to train me properly, they all passed at it. I started to slack at the register and bar, I was put to clean trash and bathrooms everyday for about 3 weeks straight. When I complained to the SM, she will come up with the most ridiculous explanation.",
          "I ordered a tall ice coffee and a cup of ice water, and they gave me a grande ice coffee and tried to charge me for it when I specifically told them that I wanted a tall. Another time the Starbucks employee gave me my change and told me not long after that she had given me too much change (that she had given ten cents extra) and when I gave it back to her she was no longer over the counter and instead of putting the money back into the drawer she just took it in her hand. Just yesterday I walked into a Starbucks to order my usual tall ice coffee and the employee gave me an attitude and spoke to me in a barely audible voice, and she looked visibly distressed that I was standing in front of her ordering a drink.

          "I don't know why but the service at Starbucks on Church Street, NYC was pretty bad - rude barrister. I had ordered three different types of drink and was waiting for it; I collected the first one after a while waiting, it was not too busy. As the barrister placed the other drink on the counter, he did not say what order it was, so I picked it up and asked if this was the mocha I ordered, he said \"no it's not your drink, learn the difference\". He was very very rude about it. So I said \"okay, sorry about that\". Then I heard him telling the other customer that making the drink is not hard at all, but dealing with all of \"this\" is. And of course, he was referring to me. He shouldn't have said that. Some of the employees have bad manners, I guess they don't know what good customer service means! Individuals like that should not be working in that field.",

We were about to drive off but it was so nice outside that we went for a 10-minute walk down the road and back. When we got back, my car had been booted by the security company for that Starbucks. I explained we went for a 10-minute walk and what would the difference be if we sat inside for 10 minutes? The guy refused to remove the boot and kept saying we left the parking lot. There were no other cars in the lot because the store closed at 10, so this was completely unreasonable. I tried to get the employees inside to print the receipt showing the time but they would not help the situation. I had to pay $50 to get it removed and that was so wrong. Way to give the big ** to what was a loyal customer. I will never spend another dollar at Starbucks again.",

Another person came up behind me and also wanted a coffee, got sick of waiting and walked off. In the end, I also did myself. Who is this young lady and why is she still working here?

          "I live in Vallejo, where we don't have a lot of coffee choices other than Starbucks. It is increasingly rare that I go into any Starbucks in Vallejo, American Canyon or elsewhere, where the MUSIC IS TOO LOUD. Too loud to have a conversation, check email on my phone, read, drink my coffee, grab a quick bite, meet with friends over coffee. It's just plain TOO LOUD and it seems to be the policy at every Starbucks. For Christ's sake turn it down! Because of the loud music, I now go out of my way to avoid Starbucks.",
          "The Starbucks in Sudbury Ontario is a disgrace to Starbucks everywhere. It is old, outdated and dirty. The floor is worn out in places and doesn't ever seem to be cleaned. The countertop where the cash registers are is peeling - it looks just awful. The tables are small and wobbly. The fireplace is almost never on. The light fixtures and ceiling are full of greasy dust. It is horrible. The poor baristas who have to work there have my sympathy. Why doesn't this store have to clean up their act - and their store...",
          "Radio too loud. Could not hear person behind counter after waiting 5 mins to be helped. Not patient with me. Surprised I asked for a straw. That saying \"be kind as you do not know what the person you are talking to may be dealing with\". Not asked what flavor of coffee I would like to order. Maybe if the music was not so loud... We each would have understood each other better.",
          "What used to be a quiet spot for coffee and a morning snack has changed. In addition to baristas shouting orders, there is the tapping of stainless steel containers and music turned up to an annoying level. Trying to get the attention of a barista to inform them of the extraneous noise is almost impossible. To end, I assume Starbucks has made their gobs of dollars and that the customer's attitude can be damned. I have been a customer of Starbucks for at least 15 years; I may have to drink elsewhere.",
          "I find the overhead music to be offensively pervasive and berating common intelligence most of the times with the unknown artist’s lyrics. The lyrics are very antagonistic and condescend the listener's (in this case mine) feelings, thoughts, and activities leaving me to personally feel attacked and vulnerable to the programming it’s perpetrating in my unconscious mind.",
          "My daughter looked forward to going to HQ every morning for a cake pop and then asked to go up to the 8th-floor lobby and gift shop. After doing this every morning for months, we were asked to leave, though we were disrupting nobody. Won't be going back.",
          "Every time I am in a Starbucks I find they are dirty and many times the restrooms are not only dirty but no soap, etc., employees fix food etc...they charge enough to be BETTER! A person needs to build a cute, clean coffee shop next door to each of them and people would go do a better one and less money too.",

          "While on vacation, we stopped at this Starbucks on 3388 Poplar Ave. in Memphis Tennessee to use the restroom. By the sink of the women's restroom, there were roaches half dead. In addition to the filthy restroom, everything else inside smelled damp, like old, used towels. You could also not wash your hands with soap because there was no dispenser. There was only one other restroom available which was out of service. Will have to keep my options and eyes open from now on.",

It's a great place to study and enjoy my favorite coffee at the same time. But the last couple of times that I've been to the Starbucks by my house, I have ran into a crowd of extremely loud folks that hang around inside and speak really loud. They even arrange the couches and the chairs in a circle so they can talk. They scream across the place and even the employees working there are really loud!",
          "I came to the Starbucks on Mountain and Foothill in Upland. The store is usually clean, this time both the bathrooms needed cleaning and stocking of supplies (one had urine all over the floor). The trash bins also were overflowing. I told the barista and said he would let his supervisor know... Ok? Well 20 minutes later, still waiting for someone to go in and clean them.",
          "I've been going to this Starbucks Independence location across from Independence Center Mall for years and service has been getting worse but yesterday, it hit rock bottom. Both girls were extremely rude, asking why I was in there. \"Duh, dumb **,\" to get coffee! Upon ordering the drink and food for a friend, the one girl threw the food on the counter nearly causing it to hit the floor and the other girl named Alyssa, making the coffee, tossed the container on the counter nearly causing the cup to hit the floor. Okay, it's just going to hit your floor and make a mess that you will have to clean up. This location is going downhill.",
          "I went to the Starbucks in San Antonio on Bitters Road, and I sat and sat for my drink. There was no one else in line and they made drink after drink for the drive thru and while I waited and waited - I noticed they clean the nozzle used to steam the milk with a dirty rag and never changed it drink after drink - I will never go back there where people inside are ignored.",

This is not the first time for me, but will be the last... of being disappointed over and over again from a GIANT corporation like Starbucks to so frequently produce so much waste. Me, enter Starbucks with own cup... order drink. Employee- uses Plastic Starbuck cup... mixes drink and pours it into my reusable mug...",
          "This is the first time I go to this store located in Bristol and 17th St in Santa Ana, California. The staff was rude, not a smile, very short. It is pretty evident that they were not trained for customer service. The floor was very filthy. It looked like it wasn´t cleaned in several days. It was dirty and coffee stains everywhere. We had to clean our table because it was dirty like the rest of the tables. My wife went to the restroom. She had to do her business standing up because it was so dirty that she didn´t dare to sit on the toilet. I will never go back to this store and maybe to Starbucks.",
          "I have come into this Starbucks location about a half dozen times. I do not go to it anymore. It is by far, the dirtiest and most unfriendliest location I have ever been to. Many times, I had to go grab some napkins and clean up a table that had coffee or whatever all over it. Newspapers are left all over the place, many of them at least a week old, and shoved into cushions, in corners, on the creamer/milk counter, etc. The cream/milk/sugar counter is always (as in always) covered with wet, sugary, spilled milk, and the trash receptacle is filled to overflowing.

          "My sweetheart and I went into our neighborhood Starbucks to get a coffee. We were standing waiting to be served looked at the food on display and noticed there was flies landing on the food and flying around. We pulled an employee aside and gestured towards the food and he said, \"Yes we are aware and it’s just a display we are not serving any of that to the public.\" We were satisfied with that response and not more than 30 seconds go by and we witness a barista taking food out of the fly infested case put in oven to warm up for the public.",
          "On Sept. 28, 2021, around 2:00 pm: Starbucks at Sherway Gardens in Toronto, Ontario. Place itself is dirty: spilled coffee on the tables, napkins under the tables. Personnel is rude - when asked to clean up the tables, in return asked to show proof of vaccination; after seeing it, still didn't clean up table. Couldn't imagine such poor service even a couple years ago. Coffee, by the way, a bit cold and tastes watered.",
          "Starbucks at 4801 West Maple Rd., Omaha, NE 68154 is very unhygienic. A fly landed on their closed dessert shelves. I went to the store to get some frappucino on my birthday. I frequent that store at least once a month for the last 5 years. My daughter and wife was with me. My daughter noticed a big fly in the cake dessert covered shelf. This fly appeared to be landing on many of the desserts. My 11-year old daughter brought this to the attention of a Starbuck service lady, but was given the brush off. I myself then brought this attention to the same lady a minute later. Initially she tried to brush me off as well, but when I insisted on knowing what she intended to do about it since it was very unhygienic. She then mentioned that once she complete making my order, she would remove the fly and all the desserts to the trash",
          "I live and worked in Soho, NYC for years. I lived around the corner of Spring Street. I began to go there a lot to use internet and meditate between life for hours or not so many and use the bathroom when I had to as I have a running bladder. I don't even drink coffee and start on decaf when I go there because I feel I have to buy. Some places are severely abusive about this. Soho is clean, at least most of time, of bathroom dirt.",
          "More than once, I enjoy a coffee or tea with my wife and children on weekends and after school during the week. Every time I notice tables are not clean. You will see coffee stains, sugar spilled, and straw wrappers. And this is in almost every Starbucks I visit (West Palm Beach Okeechobee near I 95, City Place, PGA at the mall). So one day I sent an email to their customer service department and I got a very polite response with a coupon in the mail the following week. But it never changes, I go back time and time again and there's always the same problem. Starbucks is too busy, they are driven by sales and profits only, a clean space with clean tables seems to be the last of their worries I guess.",
          "The 'music' in store is so loud it is impossible to relax, have a conversation or conduct business in my local Starbucks in Eugene, Oregon. I have asked the baristas to turn it down. They say that they will 'get in trouble' from their manager if they adjust the volume. I used to go into Starbucks two, three times a day. Not anymore. I have a Starbucks gold card since 2008. But I can no longer tolerate the noise and will take my business elsewhere.",
          "All of the Starbucks stores are filled with houseflies, which spread many diseases. There are many ways to get rid of flies, such as flypaper, but Starbucks is not interested. I complained to them a long time ago about excessive flies in their stores, but nothing was done.",
          "Harlem Starbucks 125th St. The music is way too loud... like a club not a cafe. The place was filthy. People asked me for money as I sat at my table. The owner is so greedy and cheap that he won't hire enough workers. So the place remains disgusting. Avoid this place, find a nice cafe somewhere else.",
          "I bought a Caramel macchiato last night on 03/02/2023 and there was particles of a white cleaning rag in my drink. Pretty much Starbucks isn’t doing anything which is awful and disgusting. I have lost my ambition to buy coffee from Starbucks forever after this experience and with their customer service.",
          "There is no social responsibility at Starbucks. Starbucks is one of the most polluting stores in our City. There is no recycling whatsoever. Hundreds of plastic cups are tossed into trash each day at just one location, and thousands of them with all the locations in our City. When I asked the manager for the recycle bin, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I don't know how to get one.\" I walked out and saw a recycle bin that was being used as a trash can. I contacted Starbucks' website and gave my feedback, but nothing was changed at the local stores. For a company who pretends to be all about community, they are destroying our planet faster than most of other stores.",
          "Starbucks location #11796, 7203 Hwy 329, Crestwood, KY - As a faithful patron of many Starbucks stores in several places, my favorite one until recently has been our neighborhood one. When I travel Starbucks is the first place I look for for my coffee, tea and pastries. But recently our Starbucks has become a terrible place to go. The manager is rude especially to the employees and she is not bashful about what she says and how loud her voice is. The turnover in employees has been terrible since she has been there which makes it an unfriendly place to go. ",
          "Coffee tastes like poison. Bakery is inedible. Starbucks in Dundas Ontario. Are there any Food Control organizations to check up what Starbucks food and drinks made of? I got pain in the liver area though my liver never gives me any problem.",
          "Went to Starbucks today. Bought 3 croissants. Each one came in a transparent plastic wrap. I expressed my concern regarding the environment. The barista smiled at me and emphasized on every croissant's guaranteed freshness. Today, I felt that our efforts to become a more sustainable country is a lost battle as long as these big companies don't feel the need to become more environmentally friendly. To stop passing out straws deliberately is not enough.",

          "Have been extremely loyal to Starbucks dating back to the 1990s. I would seek them out in my business travels as well as near my homes in California and near Phoenix, AZ. My work in Phoenix moves me about the valley quite a bit so I have become familiar with Starbucks locations just about everywhere in metro Phoenix. While service remains friendly, quality and product consistency have eroded rapidly over the past several years at many locations. A few remain inviting enough where you actually would enjoy sitting and visiting with friends or immersing yourself in a book, or looking up something on your gadget of choice.",
          "1005 Columbia Street New Westminster BC Canada, V3M 3X3 604-522-3002 - This Starbucks cater too much to WIFI users. The students or people don't leave until closing time. The staff encourages them to stay because it will be easy for the staff to clean up; they don't have to maintain the tables. You can buy only one coffee, the smallest and stay here until you drop dead. You can use the washroom, take home their toilet papers and drink milk after cup, after cup if you run out of money for another coffee. If you order one coffee in the morning, no need to order another. Just drink free milk. ",

Today, I went in at 5:10 am and the dark roast coffee I ordered was barely lukewarm. Since I had already left, I was not going back. The problem is that for me to go to another coffee place I have to change my routes which I am going to do. Too many mistakes with no coffee brewed, short staffed, etc. Pete's is downtown. I guess I will go there if I want coffee or go to one of the fast food places.",
          "I went in to the new Starbucks in Lakewood on Detroit Ave. People bringing their dogs in to a good service area. I can see if it was a service dog that's different and Ali no mirrors in the bathroom. They should give free refills on coffee with the price they charge for coffee. Panera bread gives free refills. They should have a senior discount for people that can't afford Starbucks prices. Customer service was okay. Kathy.",
          "Starbucks customer service is horrible! Worst experience I ever had. No replies, help or understanding. Very cheap and rude! I cannot believe this is a big company. I do like their coffee. Too bad they have such a bad management.",

The customer service had been pretty good during this time until the last few months. Most of the employees now working at the two Starbucks in my neighborhood are horrible, and don't seem to know a thing about good customer service. If you've ever done a Google search about customer service at Starbucks, you know what I'm talking about. There are numerous comments about how bad the customer service is, and I can definitely say that I agree 100%. ",

One of my favorite past times has been catching up on emails while enjoying coffee and food. Now, I cannot come back knowing that I can’t be productive while there. Ya just lost a LOYAL customer for almost 20 years. Wow. Just wow.",
          "I've recently realized how difficult it is to find a Starbucks that has electrical outlets available to customers for charging laptops and cellphones. At first I thought, oh this particular store just never installed them. However, that's not the case. They have purposefully removed them in order to save electricity, a slap in the face to us loyal customers who spend gobs of money on their overpriced drink and food already. I always figured, well it makes sense, I'll pay the extra price for the opportunity to enjoy hanging around using WiFi and tapping some power, but they've gone too far now. Uh uh, you guys are not right! I still appreciate free ice cold water and whipped cream for my dog, but in the back of my mind lurks the knowledge that they have given and taketh away. I've banned you from my go to restaurants list, in fact I might never step into a Starbucks ever again! That was a shameful thing you guys did!",

It's more often than not been a daily habit for me and I've been to more of their stores (in multiple states) than I can even remember. One thing I started noticing is they routinely ran out of stock in their stores. That is to say, certain snack items and even certain beverage ingredients would be depleted very often. It got to the point where I would ask for a certain item and (almost every time) they'd tell me they had to check to see if they even had it.",
          "I am a highly unsatisfied that I went to try the unicorn by Thursday 4/20 and every Starbucks I went to was sold out. This is saddening because I am a huge fan of Starbucks and to be overly excited about something that I was not able to try is unreasonable and not customer friendly.",
          "I love Starbucks!!! I frequent Starbucks everyday, couple times a day. I miss the excellent customer service from Starbucks employees, especially at this Starbucks location at 3898 S. 900 E SLC, Utah 84106. My first horrible encounter at this location was a drive thru last week where my order was taken and as I approached the next window to remit payment. I had to keep my hands hanging out in attempt to pay for over 2 mins as the Starbucks employees were busy chatting and laughing amongst themselves while my hands were left to hang. Very unprofessional, disregard for their customers, I felt!!!",
          "Starbucks has the worst customer service in two locations in Denver. 44th and Federal and 40th and Colorado Blvd in Denver Colorado and they always get the order wrong. What I don't understand is if you're gonna want to work with people? Do it right. When you screw up an order? Own up to it. We as customers pay a lot of money for something here at Starbucks. Please get better!!!",

Now if you ask them to remake your drink some of them are okay with it but others have a lot of machismo or just way too much attitude. The consistency of the drink tasting as it should from different locations is rare here in El Paso. If I would recommend anything I would recommend Mesa Street in the Westside. There's a girl there by the name of Vanessa. She's actually a great barista.",
          "Ok I know how the staff at Starbucks at 23811 Washington Ave, Murrieta, CA · (951) 461-1699 the service has to be one of the worst I have ever been to. I started going to this one over 2 months ago and they still don't know my drink. Now it is very difficult. It's any hot coffee with 10 sugars stirred in then extra cream 1/2-1/2. Now if that's too hard to get how the hell did they get a job. I have been to Starbucks all over and in less than 3 days they know my drink but not here where 2 months ain't enough to understand something so simple and yes I go in every day.",
          "This Starbucks at the Festus location has terribly slow service… Also, the location is terrible.

          "I am Michael, I live in Columbus, Ohio. I use a variety of Starbucks locations in this city and service at the individual shops seem to be very good. However navigating their website to sign up for the apps and phone pay is a circus. I am incredulous that a company who claims to care for their client base as this one does has seemingly no one paying any attention to detail or even who gives a damn about the customer. I guess they do not want my money. I can work with this. We also have several local coffee shops who have great coffee and I now will frequent them more often! Starbucks you are losing your customer base with no customer loyalty. Train your baristas to be good people persons while at work and fix the danged website!",
          "Starbucks near me just launched new fall foods and beverages yesterday. By noon yesterday they were out of all new items. The fall launch is huge and many people look forward to it all year. Maybe if you don’t have enough product to last even a couple of days, push back the launch until you do? I was so happy to get the email that it had come out that I left work on my break to brighten my day and so very disappointed to get there at 12:30pm and find out that it was all gone. Please Starbucks, do better.",
          "I have been a committed Starbucks customer for years, in fact since they came to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I use the store on Jonestown Road and the store on Stratford Road. I had almost decided that I would stop using the stores because the staff has become so inexperienced. The lines are very long and in the morning when we are trying to get to work; an unnecessary delay due to lack of staffing and inexperienced staff is the last thing that you wish to encounter.",
          "I have enjoyed Starbucks for years as well as the free wifi. Currently I am homeless and utilize the free internet Starbucks on Foothill Blvd, in Pomona California provides. Until now. Starbucks has called the police on myself and my boyfriend several times. I assumed for being in the parking lot a little too long or because our van is a bit of an eyesore with all of our things piled on top. ",
          "They wonder why they have to shut down locations. This company should be called makeothercoffeecompaniesbucks because they don't care in helping people out who can't get into their mobile accounts. Second time this year I get locked out of my account and no matter what I do I can't get in and then when you call customer service they can't speak/understand English and say they fixed the problem when nothing gets fixed, then someone tells you someone will call you and nobody does. I'm done with this company. Thanks for saving me hundreds a month!!!",
          "I have been a loyal Starbucks since 2008, the year that our smaller town finally got a Starbucks location. Since that time, they have expanded to three stores and one smaller store within our local Safeway/Ridley’s. I am a gold card holder, a very loyal Starbucks customer and have recently found myself defending Starbucks to a few people who had read misinformation and rumors about Starbucks to defend my continuing support of Starbucks.",
          "I've done my research and it seems like Starbucks does hiring people who hasn't worked in this industry \"coffee\". You just need to have good customer services. You can't teach anyone how to talk to people but you can always reach them how to make something. I have 5 plus years in retail customer services but both places said I have no experience. They both hired people who worked at Starbucks or have experience. Yes, it's very true I don't have the experience, but I have the customer services. I thought I did great in the interview. I feel like if they only wanted experienced people, they shouldn't had even given me a call or an interview me. I felt my time wasted and their time wasted too.",
          "This STARBUCKS Location has the worst customer service out of all the locations in Palm and Beyer San Diego Ca 92154. I been Starbucks for years and now is time to say Good Bye! I noticed that employees are overwhelmed and they take it against customers. I noticed that they are unhappy stressed and I don’t want that negative experiences anymore. I’m tired of been getting wrong items and if I placed a mobile order that has been taken away by another customer or by a homeless. Starbucks needs to come up with a better plan to keep business running, customers but the most important thing is to keep employees happy and motivated in order to provide customer service and focus on their duties. I’m deleting my Starbucks app because I rather buy my espresso machine and make my own coffee from now on. I want to enjoy my coffee happier! Thank you.",
          "I was at a Starbucks in Kleinburg, Ontario. I was very unhappy that I was told that I could not have my mozzarella and spinach panini. It could not be warmed up because the machines were all being cleaned. The time was 9:26 pm and they close at 10 pm. I had to take my panini home, which was a 25-minute drive from there. I was not happy at all. I am a paying customer and I should be able to have a panini warmed up even at 9:55 pm. It shouldn't be my problem that the employees would like to be home by 10:05 pm. I hope this doesn’t happen again and that I can be compensated for this issue. Thank you for your time.  ",

Over the last 6 months employees have become rude with mad looks on their faces, not smiling, and not saying \"thank you.\" When I go to put a top in the jar, they have already turned their backs without a \"thank you\". Whether the store is busy or slow, customer service has taken a huge nose dive into ZERO service. Also, I have been served hard pumpkin bread several times and the frappuccinos are not consistently made correctly. Do they really know the recipes? When I ask them to make one again, I get a dirty look and no apology.",

But I would buy every Saturday cookies and they were nice size, and delicious. But then around 4 years ago they got smaller and smaller and stop buying them. I went to a new Starbucks in Plantation Florida on Sunrise Boulevard. They just opened up last week I looked at all their food. Their muffins are so small and their cookies are so tiny. You guys should be embarrassed and that's with a capital EMBARRASSED. One of the employees heard me say, \"You guys should be embarrassed,\" and he nodded with his head up-and-down not saying a word. He agreed with me. I will never go to your store again. If I could RATE YOUR STORE EXPERIENCE A MINUS ONE -1 store I would.",

Neither smelled good to begin with, and the buns on both were stale. Sausage was old on the chicken sausage biscuit, with no sign of chicken, unless you count a blob of goop! Bacon was not cooked properly on either that sandwich, nor the bacon egg cheese sandwich. Visibly inedible, we would not have risked the uncooked bacon and whatever other strange things were on there! Obviously, we DO want refund for this poor Starbucks ‘offering’. Unfortunately, did not have my Starbucks card with me, so had to charge Visa. Then the girl at the drive-thru window neglected to offer my receipt!",
          "It costs over $20 for 3 small breakfast sandwiches!! These should be $2-$3 a piece like every where else. And the greeting from the server was rude. A simple, “What do want“ is not a greeting! Too expensive and poor service!!! I won’t go back there!!",

No one looked happy to be there. When I placed an order, I also asked a question about a breakfast sandwich (no one standing in line behind me)... for both things I practicality got an eye roll and a reluctant answer. The sandwich was thrown on the counter in front of me and when I said \"thank you,\" no one even looked up or responded. I would've made my coffee at home for this treatment.",
          "I am suffering from a health condition where I cannot have cheese in my sandwich. As Starbucks has no \"no cheese sandwich\" option I usually ask the serving barista to remove the cheese from the sandwich before heating it up. This Starbucks is located in University Blvd W. (32207) at Jacksonville FL. The Barista did not want to remove the cheese and when I asked her nicely to do so she started mocking me like a 6 year old kid (except in a psychotic way). Then to top it all she literally \"destroyed\" my chicken sandwich just because I asked her (nicely) to take the cheese off. ",

I was thinking the third time might be a charm but it turned out the same as last two visits. A bust! I have to say the people behind the counter and window could use training in customer service also. They have lots to say to each other and leave the customer hanging out to dry. Sad thing is I waited with great anticipation on this store opening. It's difficult to turn into - bump tires on car in drive-thru lane.

I don't drink Starbucks very often and if I do I go to the one on military and never had an issue there whatsoever l! BUT TODAY, I happen to be in the town east area and decided to treat myself to a frappe!

We'll call you regarding winning a raffle...\" and as of today... briefly plugging in my travel blender to brief spurts of ten second noise so I can have a morning breakfast drink. Was again told by Jenn I was disruptive and could not plug it in at the table while noise from blenders in their kitchen blasted everyone's ears... contradictory.

I chose this particular Starbucks because I could come and have a quiet time in a comfortable chair, to rejuvenate and forget the world in a book.

It was nice at first, but then I noticed that the employees were laughing when I walked in and I heard them talking about me. ",

I immediately contacted the Provo Starbucks, where I bought them, and they apologized and gave me my money back, which was nice, but not enough. I was sick for two days afterward, which makes me wonder what other surprise ingredients were in it, and completely disgusted with Starbucks ever since. I'm really sad. I LOVED the egg white egg bites, and Starbucks has been my go-to cafe for years.",

Overall, I agree with many of the comments others have made regarding inattentive and sometimes seemingly uncaring service (bordering at times on rude). On a recent visit, I felt a bit foolish for asking about the availability of a favorite pastry item. The barista who took my drink order simply said NO! This sparked a [snarky-ish] discussion amongst the other baristas who remarked that they hadn't seen this time for some time. I said, \"Oh is it seasonal, then?\" There was really no need for the ridicule, IMO.",

I left and had to go back asap because the cream cheese given to me was an opened and used one. I asked for the Manager and she accommodated me but I had to say my piece to Chris who served me. I told him what was he even thinking about???? With all the plague all over the world why would you do that. He apologized but it never affected me because I don't know why he did that. Asked him why give me somebody else cream cheese??? What if it is contaminated. So how can I trust Starbucks now. Is that the training you have for your employees??? It is so Disgusting. I wish I could attach a picture of the  cream cheese. So consumers check what you buy all the time.",

The staff, told me Starbucks is making it extremely uncomfortable for a family to eat inside, and difficult for couples, people with special needs, basically everyone. The table is a little bigger than a stool.

Asked if I could get fruit toast for my grandson and if the pieces could not be end pieces as they are too hard for him to chew. What did we get? End pieces. So the toast didn't get eaten because it was too hard for him to chew. Back to Costa for me.",

This is the same mess they not only gave me here in Philly but sides of attitude with it. Location here on a popular street there's one barista that for some reason has it out for me. I've never given attitude or made crazy demands yet he is always condescending when talking to me and purposely messes up my food. One barista will twice cook my bacon like I ask so it's cooked. The miserable one however cooked the sandwich twice giving me burnt bread and raw bacon. I don't know if he thought I wouldn't notice or come back considering my job is right across the street. ",
          "Know I frequent 3 different Starbucks in my area, the closest one does not have a drive-through but the other 2 do so if I have my little kids with me I go to the drive-thrus. When I'm by myself I used to go to the non-drive-thru store. Oxnard, CA and Port Hueneme, CA. Why is it every time one goes to any one of these Starbucks and orders something off their food menu, eight out of 10 times they're out of it... \"Can I have the slow roasted ham and cheese?\" Then the cashier says, \"Oh wait, let me check and see if we have any... oh I'm sorry, were out of that.\" And I say \"How about the grilled cheese sandwich?\" Then the same reply... \"Sorry, we're out of that, too.\" Then I say, \"Can you check to see if you still have any of the THE NEW beef sandwich on sourdough that you have pictures plastered all over place?\" Guess what the reply is???",
          "On two occasions, I placed an order for a toasted bagel with cream cheese. First time, I placed my order and proceeded to the cashier and paid (line was long). When I returned, there were 2 orders already on the counter (morning crowd) and I thought one of them was mine. The young lady yanked it from my hand and said it was not mine and my bagel order was not even started. Second time, I requested a multi-grain bagel and was told that they were out by the cashier. Another person pointed to the display case and said \"whatever is there is what we have\". Okay, so I asked for a plain bagel. When she handed me the bag, I looked inside to behold there was a multi-grain bagel. She did not even acknowledge that they were both mistaken or said \"we have one after all\". This Starbucks is located in the building where I work and I find it very convenient, but a couple of the staff there are particularly rude or don't care. Thank you.",

Customers spend double the price for smoothie than any other places, hoping that it will be good compared with others, and the quality at Starbucks is worst than any other shops like Costco, McDonald's, Dunkin' Donut etc. I felt cheated by Starbucks while trash the smoothie which is like throwing $4.50 in a trash...???",

More often than not the past 6 mos, my coffee tastes gross. I am paying premium price for crap. The beans are burnt with a horrible aftertaste, they don't add flavor. It tastes like milk with water, or it's not at the kid temp I order it at. Only one store has gotten the Christmas flavors right.

That's my life everyday a year ago!!! Starbucks is no longer a coffee shop!! Their focus now is to sell sweet and heavy calorie drinks for $5. Over 35 years ago the founder of Starbucks walked in his first location, driven to make the best roasted beans and serving the best tasting coffee. That foundation is long gone.

Imagine my utter surprise and disgust when I was told today: \"We are out of Thanksgiving Blend and won't be getting anymore in. We only have 8 oz. bags of Christmas Blend.\" WHAT??!! I can't buy a pound of the seasonal coffee I adore from ANY of my local Starbucks (freestanding or in Target or Barnes and Noble) because THEY AREN'T SELLING 1 LB BAGS OF THEIR SEASONAL COFFEE. This is the stupidest idea I've heard of. I had to go home and order my pound of Christmas blend online and have it sent to me in a week. Come on, Starbucks! You need to be about the coffee, first and foremost!!!",
          "I thought a global brand as Starbucks setting extremely high beverages prices would be at least concern about their reputation, quality and hygiene! Yesterday morning I decided to get the cold lemon mint drink from Starbucks branch in City Stars Mall in Cairo, Egypt. As I was drinking, my stomach started to get upset. I checked to find out living worms in my drink!!!",
          "Went to the Linwood shop with my wife, ordered two cappuccinos hers. Didn't taste of hardly any coffee. Mine was supposed to be a double. Shot just tasted sour. Without doubt the worst Starbucks experience in my life. Felt sick. Didn't finish my coffee, also felt robbed and cheated. Won't ever return ever.",
          "Starbucks offers reusable holiday cups when purchasing a holiday beverage. They refused a diabetic an unsweetened beverage because it was not one of their “holiday” beverages. One would think they could have been more accommodating.",
          "So very disappointed with Starbucks. How is it possible to sell signature holiday drinks without the required ingredients? Their excuse for not having the supplies is getting tired. I heard these same excuses during the summer. I'd rather make my coffee from home. Plus, Starbucks has now increased their prices.",
          "I got a Starbucks gift card and ordered a coffee which was 6 dollars. One of the same size at Dunkin is 3.50. I expected with the expensive price tag to have top of the line coffee. What I got was watery coffee that tasted stale. Waited a bit to give it a second chance. Big mistake. Tasted just as bad as it did the first time. Nope! I’m gonna stay a Dunkin girl and nothing else.",
          "I have always ordered Chai tea from you and love the combos I can make with it, but I went in to a Starbucks last month and the Chai was different. It doesn't mix or even taste the same. I will not order from Starbucks anymore since this is all come to Starbucks for. Please change the Chai tea back...",
          "I'm very dissatisfied with the flavor level of the coffee Starbucks store are brewing especially in Fremont stores. They are watering down their coffee too much and the way they are upkeeping their store one sloppy mess.",
          "I recently bought 12 bags of Starbucks coffee from Starbucks.com. They did not tell me they would be sending me coffee beans that were roasted over 6 months ago. All of the bags had expiration dates that were 5 weeks from my purchase. I called Starbucks and was told they always ship their oldest coffee first but never advise customers they are doing so when the order is placed.",
          "I know a lot of people line up for this stuff but the coffee is not that good. I guess that's why they put in so many flavorings and sweeteners. If you like just coffee, try somewhere else. Many to choose from. I won't name them here. This is not an advertisement.",
          "I have been so disappointed in the last year with Starbucks. Coffee is never consistent, taste is either burnt or you ask for extra soy and it's cold because they put too much, or they get the drink wrong completely. Where I live I don't have many options to go enjoy a coffee, so it leaves me to go to Starbucks and cross my fingers I will enjoy my overpriced beverage. Now, on top of that, I used to get very excited about seeing what decorations Starbucks would put up, this year... all I see is red boxes, a crazy overpriced Sterling Silver key chain card (can't believe this piece of junk is $200). I realize they are a business, but they always had a way of ringing in the Christmas cheer with their cute cups, decor and friendly smiles. Now it's boring and the only focus is consumerism.",
          "Starbucks is getting more and more pricey for a bad cup of whatever you drink. Everyone is sucked into this need to spend half your paycheck for a bad cup of Joe. Just because it's trendy. The quality of service and product has drop over the years but the price keeps going up, up, up. I am coming from a place where I see my wife spend hundreds a month on her favorite a Chai tea. The thing that gets me is they never ever get it right when she orders. Ever. 99 percent of the time they forget to put the whip cream on even when she says \"Don't forget the whip cream.\" Or it will come warm not hot. Think about it. A drink that cost $4.80 you think you could at least make it right. Just so done with paying their prices for a sub par at best drink.",
          "How can people drink the awfully burnt tasting coffee from Starbucks. Overpriced poor tasting. Better to go to Dunkin. Starbucks uses cheaply source beans and roasts them to death. Not only burn the beans, also burn the essential oils.",
          "Regular hot coffee of different sizes is too insipid and tastes almost like hot water in several Starbucks locations in southern California. One of the possible causes for the insipidity of Starbucks regular hot coffee is that store coffee brewers are not replenished with fresh coffee in a timely manner, especially during store rush hours. We made store associates aware of this issue at a few Starbucks locations but haven't seen any tangible improvement. This is a quality control issue that warrants serious attention from Starbucks' top management.",
          "Again after 2-3 weeks again went to the Starbucks close by to get a coffee. I had been there more often before but because the 2 Starbucks around me offering boiled and muddy coffee I have avoided going there. Today again I went there. I asked if it is fresh. She said \"just made it, yes it is fresh\" then had to get the last drop off the container poured in the cup and gave it to me. It was so muddy and bad taste so I threw it away. I had paid already. Her manager was there but didn't allow barista to brew fresh coffee.",
          "I spent 29.95+tax on a simple thermal cup - Valentine's day theme. The \"Starbucks\" on the side has already come off, you can't put it in the dishwasher, can't handle carbonated drink (not that I drink soda but I may want one some day). So not worth $30. And I stopped buying their weak coffee a long time ago and I'm from the Northwest.",
          "tried everything to make it right. Still, nothing worked. First, I want to say that the same cup of coffee is being served more in Texas than in California. And it's not in just some spots, it's mostly all over Texas! Why do these people make less per hour in Texas when they actually charge more? And this is the sad part. I pay more for a bad cup of coffee for over five months that I've been back in Texas. I can't get a Caramel Macchiato that is worth drinking even if my life depends on it. I have gone to five different locations, but I give up. I was willing to pay to have a tasty cup of coffee even though I thought the price was too high!",

          "Dear Starbucks Team, received poor service in the O'Hare Oasis on Thursday, Nov 30, 2017. Not only was I sold a bag of goods; the attendant told me that with over $20 I would receive $5 back, so I dutifully ordered another $4,50 item to reach the amount, to which she said, \"Sorry the cash register didn't work. I can't make good on the offer!\" What??!! Seriously??! Are we in the US? Then I could get a receipt (for my expenses) because the same attendant threw out the receipt without asking and wasn't willing to get it or print another one? Seriously??!!! To make things worse my venti caramel macchiato which I needed after 20 hours of flight time, didn't get made. Sorry?!!! \"That 's what y'all call \"service\"?!! I'm never upset and rarely served poorly in your stores but this one is an exception that drove me to write you. Hope you fix your problems. I'm done with y'all.",
          "I ordered two to go coffee boxes at least 10 days in advance. On the day I was to pick up my order, it was not ready. In fact whoever took my order didn't even write it down. So I had to wait and wait and wait for them to drip my coffee. No discount was offered, NOTHING!!! During my wait they could've offered me a coffee while I waited. In turn this caused me to be late to my very important meeting which Starbucks doesn't care about. So basically, very poor service, uneducated staff, unpleasant service at the new Starbucks store in Fairbanks, Ak on the corner of College/Old Steese.",
          "When ordering this morning I clearly asked for a Venti drink. After I waited for a while, they brought my Grande drink and I told the barista that I had ordered a Venti. She said that they had charged me for a Grande and I said \"OK, but I ordered a Venti\" the Barista \"not happy\" started making my drink again and went to the cashier and asked her something which I couldn't hear. When she brought my drink over, she said to go to the cashier to pay the difference. Me, being a customer service supervisor, know the importance of treating your customers with kindness and knowing that if we mess up, we take the loss. What happened here? They made $0.50 but made my experience at this location very disappointing. When someone makes a mistake, own up to it and don't make the customer feel embarrassed.",
          "Let me just begin by saying the employees at this location are absolutely incredible! All but one that is. During my visit to this location I received very poor customer service from a barista by the name of \"Noreene\". I had ordered a latte and was short 5 cents. Unfortunately, I didn't have additional change on me at the time and had asked her if I could pay next time (as I am a regular at this location b/c I work next door), her response was \"no I can't do that because it comes out of my pay.\" This comment was made in front of a long line up of customers. That's unacceptable. First of all, that is extremely unprofessional. This type of thing should not be brought up in front of a customer.",
          "I will never again make a purchase or support anything that has to do with Starbucks. Requiring masks of your customers is an infringement on our rights! Playing into the political crap speaks volumes to the type of people this company is and I will not support those kind of people.",

          "Although the quality at Starbucks is currently rewarding for me in the meantime, however after witnessing disconcerting and unprofessional from one to two employees at the Rancho San Diego Starbucks located next to Petco. During May 2017 one employee who goes by the name Miranda eventually her getting more complaints from customers along with me getting the orders wrong and accused me not once but twice for harassment in addition that she frames one employee for the issues while ultimately accusing with an employee going by the name Ashley accusing me of scaring kids! Very poor quality! ",

I have worked in food service off and on for many years and owned my own restaurant so I always tip. The last two times I went to my local SB my order was incorrect. The first time I had gone to the drive through and didn't realize it until I was well on my way to where I was going and did not have the time to go back. OK, so mistakes happen. ",

But this morning, the newspapers were still bound together and had not been read or touched by a prior reader. And again, the travel section and the book review section were missing - and those are my two favorite parts! Now I realize that the prior incidents were not done by someone else and instead, this local Starbucks receives and sells a partial paper for full price. Has anyone else encountered this?",

I have gone from one location to the other trying to order without there being any issues in the last 2 weeks. I have put in 5 complaints from 3 different locations. Complaints that stem from wiping my drink off with a dirty rag, leaving hair on my cup, taking my drink back from a customer's hand that was taken into his vehicle while I sit in my car behind him and once at the window was offered the same drink, to making my drink incorrectly and instead of remaking it the employee tries fixing it by adding ingredients through the top of the plastic top.

I called corporate, who confirmed it was a fake ad. I asked my San Diego Marines about it, and they advised Starbucks was honoring it. I went online to contact Starbucks, and they said they’d look into it, call me back, and even looked on my account and said they would gift me $10. ALL WAS A LIE. I was never contacted, didn’t receive the $10 (unimportant), and reached out this morning and was hung up on. Starbucks has lost a loyal life long customer. I will also tell every veteran I know that Starbucks does not honor service members and they have no integrity. Disappointing!!!",

The smart ass young lady who wears the headset and receives payment when you pick up your order has the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my life. I do a lot of traveling for business etc. I'm not the only one that has noticed this behavior by this particular young lady. Please send her back to customer care school for training. We placed our order Sunday 5/22/2016 approx. 1-1:30pm.",
          "After numerous complaints to Starbucks about an incident that occurred at the Indian Harbour Beach, Florida store, it's quite apparent that Starbucks does not care how customers are treated. Foul language is acceptable towards customers, telling customers to shut-up is also acceptable. Slamming customers is also okay, from the rude barista at the Starbucks in Indian Harbour Beach, Florida. Be careful of writing to corporate as you will be labeled as a troublemaker, by the manager. And if you think you were treated badly before, it gets worse if they are told who wrote to corporate. I will never go back to this location. The main barista has had numerous complaints and still has a job, disgusting!",
          "Insulted by customer service representative as I called to complain instead of acknowledge they have issues and they are providing low quality. She called me suspicious even though I spend at least average 15 dollars a day. Was so upset and I decided to close the account after being with them for more than 10 yrs. Company that doesn't appreciate feedback soon to fall especially that it lost its quality.",
          "It seems as though Starbucks are forgetting that customer service and respect is the basis of any business. The locations are now making bad cups of coffee, being disrespectful to customers, and if you complain they have a nerve to want to argue with you. The managers are just as unprofessional as the baristas. The management only want numbers for their store not good customer service. I have been a loyal customer of Starbucks for years but I am done with this type of treatment. Taking my business to Panera Bread. At least I am treated respectfully and they correct errors.",
          "The Starbucks on North and Wells has got to have the worst customer service of any Starbucks I've been to throughout the entire country. Why is it if they mess up a simple drink, they give the customer an attitude? No matter how many times I clearly repeat my uncomplicated drink, more often than not, they make it wrong. Then, how dare I ask to have them politely remake it... how dare I! Newsflash Starbucks employees, if you make a drink wrong, you might have to remake it. Shocking, I know. When you make a customer's $6 drink wrong, it’s not their fault, it's yours. Therefore, instead of giving an attitude, the right thing to do would be to apologize for your error.",
          "I came lots of to Starbucks opposite Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. Last time, they got extremely horrible barista and then I did not come a while. Today, I came back because I love this place and hopefully something is changing. In contrast, I had been the worse customer service in my whole life and the barista is... is there discrimination with whom is tough speaking English as me and hated Asian person.",
          "Very bad customer service. The person who takes order does not smile and is rude. I asked if an over the counter sandwich can be heated and she rudely responded \"No\" with stern blunt voice, no apology whatsoever. I also asked another person working at the bar for water, he said \"one minute plz\" and then ignored me and started walking around the kitchen for 3 minutes or more. Finally, I went back to the order area to order water, the new barista was polite and addressed the request. Overall, very rude staff, worst staff ever seen at Starbucks. No outlets either. This experience has made me never go to a Starbucks again, ever! Specially after the horrific thing they were in the news for. I usually don't believe everything that they say in the news but given my own personal experience, I think this Starbucks at Cypress Park, Los Angeles, CA has racist staff.",

When I approached the girl she said it has nothing to do with her and I have nothing to complain about. I became very angry and told her this better not ever happen again.

Not ordering there again until this is fixed. It is a 5 dollar drink and I should be able to drink it and not have it all over the floor because of an issue on their end.",
          "I truly enjoy the Starbucks experience. I'm a huge coffee fan and love your atmosphere and your employees are great. However, your cups leak. I mainly stop into your store in Winter Park, FL on my way to my office in the mornings. When I do stop in I'm dressed for work. Inevitably your cups leak around the lid. I've smartened up and now hold a napkin up under the lip of the lid but honestly, as much as we pay for a regular cup of Joe we shouldn't have to worry about the lid leaking on our work clothes. ",
          "I am a coffee lover. I usually go to McDonald's to have a cup of latte. But today for a change, I went to Starbucks and ordered a hot cappuccino... I Sat there in Starbucks and used the free wifi. After 20 minutes something... I take my cappuccino with me as I decide to go back to my home. When I am about to reach my home... the cappuccino leaks from the lid. My dress soaked with cappuccino. It's a bad experience for me since I always buy coffee from McDonald's and it never happened to me before. Even though the coffee from Starbucks are really expensive... they are using very cheap cups. I will never go to Starbucks again.",
          "Went to open my Starbucks drink this morning at my work desk and as soon as I open the top cap, the bottom of the bottle came flying off! Soaked everything. My morning not off to a good start. Thank you Starbucks!",
          "I ordered a Venti Pike Blend coffee on October 22, 2015 via drive through. The cup was faulty, was completely soaked around the top part of the cup and the lid was not able to hold the coffee. Unaware of this, I took a drink and the hot coffee went all over the front of me ruining my brand new camel hair coat. My leather interior was soaked and reeked of coffee as well. I telephoned the store in Canonsburg, PA where the coffee was purchased. The assistant manager answered the call. I explained to her what had just happened. She said \"I can't do anything about your coat and I can't do anything about your interior. Call corporate.\" and with that she hung up. This manager has always treated me rudely. I wrote a letter to \"corporate,\" along with four (4) 8x10 COLOR photographs of the cup. ",
          "I am VERY upset with my experience today. I ordered a Americana at the drive through at a very slow time. I paid lady with app and then she disappeared, I waited extra long and then a man came and handed me my drink after someone else was behind me on the drive through. When I picked up my drink for first time while driving the lid popped off and the coffee spilled on my hand burning it, my lap, my envelope I was mailing with a check, my car and car seat. I am lucky I did not get into an accident. I called store and spoke with manager to tell her what happened. I am very offended by her response, she said sorry and explained how it could not possibly be their fault because they triple check the lid. OBVIOUSLY they did not and I should not have had to argue with her. ",
          "I placed an order through the drive thru at Starbucks on Sandhill and Flamingo, in Las Vegas. (05/20/2019 11:06 am) The order was correct, but the problem is the person at the drive thru is handling money. She put her hand over the cup lid that I will be drinking from. I wonder if this is done on purpose, because the person before me, (**) didn't have the drink handed to them like that, out of the drive thru. I'm a person of color, and this is about the third time this has happened. I've either had to have them make me another drink, or I just threw out the lid. Also, a receipt wasn't given to me. It's unsanitary practice. With all that is going on across country with this company, I would highly recommend going to a different coffee company. Will never go to Starbucks again.",
          "The Starbucks in Seattle [83 and Aurora] 95% of the time, will not put a sleeve on my Venti tall EXTRA HOT Latte. I politely tell them that cup is extremely hot to hold, thus adding a paper sleeve absorbs the heat. Their reply is usually to point to the sleeves and then states \"You can put it on yourself\" or points to the sleeves and say \"There they are\". Inexcusable conduct to a potential serious situation that can happen. The employees need to be retrained and know safety protocol to extra hot beverages.",
          "I want to share my tragically experience, on Sept 11/2021, I order coffee through drive through and when I reach through the window, she hand me the coffee which after I grab it, open from the lid falling on my hand and arm burning it, and felt all over my car door. Immediately I request speaking to the manager expecting he will instruct me to go to the Dr. and follow a report. Instead he approach with a little piece of paper and told me to write my name and phone number and someone will contact me. They contacted me 2 days later to offer me a $25.00 gift card, and told me that was my fault since the coffee was on my hand, which I told her to keep it, since I will never buy anything from them due to my bad experience.",
          "Was handed a coffee in a drive through. The lid was not on right and the top edge of the cup was bent. When I accepted the coffee and was going to place it in my cup holder, the cup bent, the lid fell off and the coffee spilled all over myself and my newly detailed interior. Not the way to start a day especially on the way to an appointment. Now $$ for coffee and detailing.",
          "April 1, 2012. It was a Sunday afternoon and at around 3 pm, my girlfriend and I decided to get Starbucks. We went to the drive through to order mocha frap for me and caramel frap for my girlfriend as usual. After we drove away from the coffee shop, I took a sip of my mocha frap - I felt something in my mouth. I immediately thought it was a piece of paper from the straw, but when I pulled it out, I couldn't believe it - it was a hair ball that I just pulled out of my mouth. I was disgusted and freaked out. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t. ",

On a recent trip to a location in Florida, I ordered a hot coffee and other items. When I picked up the coffee from my car cup holder, the sides of the cup pushed in causing the lid to pop off and the coffee to spill on the center console of my car. Right on top of the technology ball that controls my radio, XM, NAV, cell, and internal features of the car.",

Hoards of people collect at one time and that’s where it happened. We truly enjoy your espressos and cappuccinos. Unfortunately, because of this incident, we will not be returning to this location and we will be informing our friends to be vigilant when going there. This was very unfortunate.  ",

I got out of line and parked instead to run in for quicker service. I stood in line with 4 people ahead of me. There were about 6 people that I could see working, one of which was at the register. I stood in line for another 4 minutes with no movement again, so I left. I wasted almost 10 minutes just waiting in those lines. There was no sense of urgency in the staff when I went in.",

I was then made an iced coffee, plain, that had some caramel drizzled over the top of it. I asked did the caramel macchiato not have actual caramel in it? That this coffee looked like a plain iced coffee with some caramel drizzled on top? One of the girls making coffee said that's exactly how we're supposed to make them and thrust the Starbucks recipe book at me and told me to look it up if I didn't believe her. ",

The only thing correct about the drink was the size, which not even this location could mess up. Overall, I would not recommend this store or return.",

Not only did the barista making my iced Americano give me almost no ice (if I remember correctly I asked for an iced Americano), he also gave me this very dirty look when I asked he put more ice in the drink. That was nothing, however, compared to what his shift-lead for the store did with my second drink. ",

          "I live in Grove City, Ohio and our Starbucks employees are awesome and friendly! I go there so much they know me. So my complaint isn't about our franchises here or the employees. I am bored of the choices that are offered and I think the Mocha Coconut Frappe should be brought back! It's cool and refreshing and not too rich. It seems that if you don't like caramel, your choices are pretty limited, which I find annoying. I always look forward to the change of seasons to see what new things you're going to have but lately it's just the same stuff over and over again! So, I have resorted to trying frozen coffee drinks elsewhere because it's something different! And they are cheaper! I want the Mocha Coconut brought back along with the Mocha Malt Frappe that you had summer 8 years ago or so. It was very, very good!",
          "I like coffee with just a bit of cream. Not all this flavorings with high fructose corn syrup. When you receive an iced drink you receive a full cup of ice with little drink in it. Coffee is too expensive. Rather go to a cafe and always receive free refills. Won't happen there.",
          "I reached out to Starbucks customer service centre on 2 to 3 occasion and they will reward me with $10 card or free coffee but not solving the issue on the ground. Issue - when you ask for Tall and pay for Tall but you end up receiving one half or less. This isn’t about one location. This at multiple locations within Charlotte, NC and Richardson, TX. Learning - it’s top down message to reduce the quantity without letting customer know. Else why is it same across multiple locations. Option: 1) every time you buy request server to fill the cup up; but doesn’t work every time. Or 2) shift to other coffee brands. Question - is there anyone also feeling the same with reference to quantity or not? Personally - Seems I am done with Starbucks as I don’t believe money is the solution. It’s more about experience, quality and quantity (promised).",
          "It has chemical odors and makes me gag. My friend dared me to have some and I barfed all over the store. They spelled my name wrong on purpose, my name is Kemmis but Starbucks spelled it as Chemist and I said, \"That's not my name, it's Kemmis.\"",
          "I was a regular customer, ended up hating Starbucks due to their poor customer service and unkept promises. Let me write down what I have gone through: 1. Collected stickers (18 beverages) to collect 2019 Planner/Organizer. (Completed 4 Sets). 2. I have redeemed 2 of them. By February, their stocks were low, and choices were limited. The barista told me to wait for \"restocking\" for more choices. 3. By March, there were ZERO stocks and I was not able to collect 2 Planners. Baristas told me two choices: a) Wait until May; or b) Get 1,500 Php = 29.33 USD for each set. I decided to wait knowing that I have collected these stickers for the planner/organizer. I have spent more than 3,000Php per set and it does not compensate me with 1,500Php.",
          "When I order a Venti Skinny vanilla latte it is always Never full - so much foam. Even when I inform the clerk No Foam. When I receive the coffee it always has at least 1 inch or more of foam and the coffee isn't for me, it's for my wife. I quit going to Starbucks and cancel my Gold Card. The company don't seem to Care. It's all about the money.",
          "Earlier today (November 18th/11), I went to the Starbucks WestOaks Mall location in Abbotsford, BC. I ordered a Grande Gingerbread Eggnog Latte reduced fat and the total had come to $6.10. When a week earlier, I went to the Starbucks down the road on South Fraser Way Abbotsford, BC, and the total was approximately $5.00 (I don't remember the exact total) but it was not $6.10. I'm just wondering why at the WestOaks location it cost more.",
          "My husband goes to the Virginia Hills Starbucks in Martinez, CA every morning for our coffee. I always have a Venti Cinnamon Latte. For the last two months the amount in the cup has been getting less and less. This morning my latte level was at the third square down that reads syrup. I'm sorry, but for the amount of money we pay for this I expect the cup to be pretty full. This may seem like a small thing to complain about but I can tell you this is the first time I have ever made a customer complaint so it isn't small to me. I won't be buying from this Starbucks again.",
          "I'm a gold member and regular at Starbucks. I've been going every day for the past 7 years spending thousands of dollars per year ordering the same drink. The white mocha I get costs $5.50 every day. It's a quad venti 4 pump no whip WM. But in the past year or so, the baristas have been lazy on numerous occasions. They never mix the syrup like before. Now I have to ask them to which is crazy. I mean how much more should I spend for them to do their job. It's not a huge complaint but if I don't check it, I sometimes suck up pure syrup. Just venting on my venti.",
          "I frequent about 10 Starbucks in the Richmond Virginia area. I noted that prices have risen 10% in the past year but I still buy. It seems that now in 2020 8 out of 10 times when I purchase a Venti coffee, the cup is only partially filled. Most times 2 inches short. I ask for whipped cream but rarely get it. If I don’t make them open the cup before they hand it to me to verify the drink, I have to call and or go back through the drive thru to have them fix it. Seems I am paying for a Venti but get a Grande most times. Since the happens across multiple stores, it seems to be the new business model requiring the customer to QA the quantity and quality of the order. I think Starbucks has started to decline and is now out priced themselves in the market. The “Coffee Experience” is no more when you can’t trust them when you place an order.",
          "I noticed when I ordered a medium it was really a small. With all that's going on why would you shrink the size of your cups!!! McDonald's is doing the same! This is not good. Starbucks brings way too much money in to cheat your customers on cup size gouging.",
          "I just recently moved to Renton Washington and have never had poor made drinks when going to other Starbucks. First, my drink is Venti Iced Mocha, with half of one pump mocha, no whip. From the time I started going to this Starbucks, they have but once got my simple drink order right, plus they charge me the whole mocha price, when everywhere else charges me a Latte price. Every time they mess up my simple drink, it is me having to wait and wait with no sorry, or a free drink offer, and it really upsets me. ",
          "My daughter who is in Lubbock started complaining that whenever she went to the Starbucks near campus, she would always get about a half of a cup of what she ordered. Well the past couple of visits I have noticed the same problem. For a student such as my daughter and a teacher like me, Starbucks is a treat for both of us since it is on the expensive side. When we order a grande or whatever, we expect a grande. Do not tell me it's because whip cream or milk can be added. Neither of us have any of it. It's extremely disappointing to pay over 5 dollars for coffee when I am not getting the expected size.",
          "Yes I was at the Starbucks in Fort Benning, GA yesterday 09/02/17 and ordered a two White Chocolate Mochas and at first they were served to me cold after paying $13.00 for 2 cups. Then the other coworker remade them and they were still cold. I will continue to visit our Circle Ks here in Columbus, GA and pay 0.99 for a medium cup of GREAT coffee. This is beyond ridiculous. I will never give Starbucks any of my money.",
          "Your mocha tastes like someone defecated in my cup and didn't even bother to warm it up. Before the racist incident I couldn't stand you all and the pretentious fools who think drinking dirty water is \"hip\" because it has a logo on it. I'm sticking with Caribou Coffee.",
          "I have been a loyal customer of Starbucks for over 15yrs. Lately I have noticed my venti blond has a blah taste. More like cheap gas station coffee. It wasn't just me, I asked several family members what they thought. They verified it was gross coffee! What happened!? I even tried several other Starbucks. Same problem. Really Starbucks! Do you think we won't notice when you hike the price of your coffee and cheapened your product? I guess another good thing has bit the dust. I can make my own gross coffee at home????",

Upon arrival, my boyfriend asked if a drip coffee was available as we are not<br>heavy coffee drinkers and wanted to venture out of our usual drinks. The barista first laughed and I<br>can clearly hear from the drive thru window of her telling her colleagues of what we ordered while<br>chuckling, then she asked what size we wanted. We ordered a tall and then proceeded to ask if an<br>Americano was stronger in caffeine or the drip coffee. She sarcastically said that coffee is<br>stronger than espresso, but was chuckling the whole time and double repeated that I just wanted a<br>\"tall plain black coffee\". We then proceeded to the window and the same barista leaned out of the<br>window to say, \"I'm sorry that I laughed, but you don't think we have coffee here at a coffee shop?\""

At least four times the barista tipped the larger brewer giving me the \"bottom of the<br>barrel.\" I'm glad I was watching. They apologized and gave me coffee from another container. I don't<br>think it's the employee's fault, I'm sure they're following corp policy. Also I've witnessed so many<br>discrepancies of cost, charges, add on charges, on and on. I've witnessed folks order food and ask<br>where is the order. I hear the barista say \"I forgot, sorry.\" This with only a few customers in the<br>store. Sadly it seems they don't pay the experienced baristas to stay and hire new folks and train<br>them on the job. You hear at the register \"oh, excuse them they're in training\" or \"This is my<br>second day.\" I only go to SBX if a friend is paying for my drink. :)"
